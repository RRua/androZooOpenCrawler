My Phone without root, and have no native tile to toggle debuging. Also tcp for wifi debug is also enabled.

I have one request: could the tile for toggling USB Debugging require unlocking the phone?', 'Usefull app! One feature I would really wish was here is if it had a tile which would disconnect and detect usb again so i could switch apps instead of toggling debugging which is what i use for now.', '"Keep screen on" & "Demo mode" tiles have saved me hours! Thanks.', 'Cool app. But would be the best if it had force dark mode :p.', 'This app would be perfect if it had a button to try to execute the command as root.', 'it does what it says on the tin. good for quickly turning some dev settings on and off.', 'Super handy!', "It's very useful. One thing I should mention as drawback is when you have root the app could detect that and do everything by itself. Now you have to download terminal and copy and paste the commands one by one. Other than that its great!", 'Love this! I use it to toggle USB debugging off when I want to watch my spectrum TV app. Thanks!!', 'Love it \U0001f929 would it be possible to include an option for Kill all \nactivities?', 'Solves the problem perfectly, and without complications. I would pay for \nthis.', 'Great app will recommend it to everyone', 'good', 'I would like to see a "show layout boundaries" tile.  edit: Thanks for reply. I\'m aware that Nexus, Pixel and probably other OEMs provide this tile but unfortunately Samsung does not.', 'Android 7.1 added dev tiles but this adds even more.
