    "body": "# 1 Eco points\n\nThis version adds eco points.\n\n> **Note!** Eco points are still in beta and not available to the public yet. The public release will be in early September 2016.\n\n## 1.1 What are eco points?\n\nEco points are some sort of gamification, where users can collect points by driving with SASA buses. The users will be displayed on a leaderboard with their corresponding points. Eco points use the beacon technology (Bluetooth) to track a bus ride and determine the driven kilometers, which will then result in the rewarded points. Each driven kilometer will give you 10 points.\n\n> **Warning!** Any points earned by beta testers before the public release will be deleted upon the release of the public version.\n\n## 1.2 Badges\n\n### 1.2.1 What are badges?\n\nBadges represent challenges the user needs to complete. Different badges give you a different amount of points upon completion. There are multiple types/categories of badges, e. g. scanning a bus stop and bus beacon, driving a specific amount of kilometers or trips.\n\n### 1.2.2 Special badges for events\n\nThere are special badges for events in South Tyrol like the Mobility Day on Sep 18 in Merano. These badges can only be earned in a specific period of time, for example on one day. As they are not so easy to get, they are worth a lot of points. These badges may be combined with another gift or present at the event. In Merano the user is also given a bag besides the badge in the app. When getting one of these badges a QR code will be returned too. This is explained below more in detail.\n\n## 1.3 Events\n\nEvents are activities where users may use the beacon technology in the app in order to earn some additional points in the eco system. An event consists of multiple checkpoints where users can go and learn something about the event's topic. There will be attached beacons at every checkpoint of the event. If a user has scanned all beacons he will be awarded with a badge and a QR code. The QR code is used in order to proof the completion of the event to staff members who are handing out gifts to the users who went to all checkpoints. Events are yet not usable in this version but are part of the eco point system.\n\n# 2 Bus details\n\nBus details show the users which type of bus they have selected. Bus data includes the manufacturer and model of the bus along with the fuel it uses (hydrogen, diesel or methane, in the future electricity might be added). The user additionally has the possibility to report a problem in the selected bus.\n\n## 2.1 Favorite lines and bus stops, new list order of driving lines\n\nIn case the user does not have any favorite lines or bus stops, the app automatically swipes to the second tab, instead of displaying an empty screen. The order of the driving lines was changed to match the one of the all lines tab.\n\n## 2.2 Removal of vehicles 257, 263 and 265\n\nThese vehicles are no longer in service and have thus been removed.\n"
