The UI is very well thought out and it's set up to allow swiping from screen to screen for different activities such as combat or inventory or taking notes etc. If you're a lover of these books then this is all you'll ever need to play. Very highly recommended.", 'An invaluable tool to play FF gamebooks. Really nicely designed with the different screens that you can swipe through, and great that it matches the different gamebook setups. The only thing that could improve it is to allow you to edit existing notes rather than post new ones, but this is minor. Enjoying reading FF again using this!', "First of all this damn thing will crash back to the book cover screen where you click start new adventure nearly every single time on the galaxy TAB A meaning you have to fill in the start up stats at least twice sometimes THREE times. When it finally does work MOST books you can play properly with REAL dice since you can alter the in game dice rolls and also do battles manually. However there are some books you CANNOT play with real dice starship traveler being one it's impossible to alter the stats of your crew if you want to use real dice rolls. It's all well and good to have everything digital but using real dice keeps the spirit and fun of these books. There needs to be options in ALL books for manually dice rolls.", 'Missing 4 books (Blood of the Zombies, Stormslayer, Night of the Necromancer, Assassins of Allansia), but still an invaluable help!', 'i do not onow how i ppayed as a kid in the 80s and 90s without something like this.

Deathtrap Dungeon has a flaw in the initial stats display. It only shows 1 digit instead of 2. So if your stamina is 21 it only displays the 2. If it's 19 it only displays the 1.", "Love that you have options for other languages in the settings. Several of my FF books are in French and it's easier to be able to have the app and book in the same language.", "It's great for the books that are supported. Would like to see more from vault of the vampire onwards", "Think it needs auto save ability and/or a warning when you are going back to the menu to prevent lost progress if you've forgotten to save.", "Brilliant app, it saves me writing in my game books and writing out my own adventure sheets. Can't recommend it enough", 'Great app, but it would be really good if you could see your own stats in the combat tab', "Played Forest of Doom for an hour, saving my adventure as i went, but it says there's nothing there to load.", 'Does what it says...and for free it deserves 5 stars', 'Is the must nuts', 'Rubbish dont instal', 'This app has made me pick back up my fighting fantasy books, now if I die I can restart at a checkpoint or if I start again I can have a new game up and running in seconds. The automated combat makes fighting so much faster. The only thing I miss is a mapping function but with all this offers I can live with that. The look of it could do with being a like the books theme wise but the interface is so clean and easy to use. Top marks to this app, I would have happily paid money for this.', "Fantastic!

Also this has given me a new imports to finally collect the whole set. Do you have any idea of the time line of book to app? Also how far do you anticipate taking the app? I mean do you intend covering all of the books? Thanks for a great app.", 'EDIT: So, the app is still in development which means that not all the books are playable at the time. Which is fair.
