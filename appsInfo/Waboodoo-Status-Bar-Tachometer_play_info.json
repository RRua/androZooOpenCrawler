No unnecessary features or app permissions. And it's free with no ads! What could be better? Nothing that's what.", "This is just what I was looking for, tiny speedometer I can see in the status bar, but I want it to work right. I was sitting on the sofa as lazy as it gets and this speedometer said I was going 7.3km/h... not as accurate as I hoped. And one more thing, It's a bit too simple, but simple can be good. This app would be perfect if you fix just this one problem", "This handy app let's me know how fast I am going when biking. Works great while trying to hatch eggs in PokémonGO  (even though PokémonGO is horribly broken at the moment, no tracking FTL)", 'Need more accurate than whole number display in status bar. Going to at least a tenth would make this a 5.0 star app. &lt;-- See what I did there?', "I was very glad to find this app, especially for it's simple yet effective action.", 'but what I would like is some more options like the amount of decimals showing in the statusbar.', 'Excellent App!
