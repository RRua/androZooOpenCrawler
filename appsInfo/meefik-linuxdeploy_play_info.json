I\'ve basically found Linux Deploy to be exactly what it is, an application for configuring and deploying a container. It\'s not flawless but then again, who thinks they should be able to download a free container application to run flawlessly on a hacked piece of hardware running a makefit, unsupported OS. I have installed and tried Alpine, Kali and Ubuntu and it has exceeded my expectations. Thanks Anton!', 'It can easily get 5 star but start and stop button not working from notification panel. Besides exit button also needed to be added at the notification panel', 'App will not recognize any connection but Wi-Fi, screw everything else. ie: not F.O.S.S. therefore rejected, on my phone, what u do w/URS is on U.
