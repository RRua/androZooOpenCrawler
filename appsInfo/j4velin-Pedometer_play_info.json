It offers integration with g-games for achievements to gamify and help motivate you. I wish this app had a history view to see my week, monthly , yearly progress. Also that it calculated the total burned energy.', "I really like this app.  Simple, uncluttered,does what I want and doesn't get in the way. But on Friday it recorded 63k steps.  Now, I was traveling that day (UK to Norway including two ferries) but I've done that twice before without it counting such a high number.  I'm not concerned, just curious about the mechanism.", 'Its the most efficient among all available apps. Love it because its foss and there are no stupid permissions. One star less because it does not show calories burned and its not 100% accurate.', "The best pedometer so out there. Sadly with Android pie and the aggressive closing of background apps, dosent work now. Can't see how to get Android to stop closing it.", 'Does not work on Nokia 6.1 (Android 9). Counted 5 steps since I installed it 2 days ago. Even went for a 20 minute walk.', 'Was using it with different phone, LG Astoria 2. Since buying a Nokia 6.1 a week ago, the app is not working.

Lacks unfortunately of long-term \nstatistics (month, year... ). I switched now to the app of my phone \nmanufacurer as it has more features.', "This was my must-have app till the last update.. and now it simply stopped working all together. Even when notification is on, it only counts steps when it's main screen is open and stops counting as soon as I minimise it. Even when it's open, it makes increments of two for each step I take. It's so sad.. I wish I could get the original app back.. I am on Xiaomi Mi Max 2.", "I like the concept of the app with its minimalistic design but it somehow fails to store data for the current day correctly. Therefore, if you have to reboot your device for some reason, you will find that the app will afterwards report a much higher number of steps for the current day than it did before. Sometimes this issue will go away if you put the app into the background for a minute and then open it again, but usually the wrong value persists, messing up the statistics. If this is fixed, I'll gladly give the app five stars.", "First installed it and loved it but the past few weeks the app has been \npractically broken. It tells me I'm 27000 steps away from my goal of 10000 \nsteps. Other times it'll randomly reset my steps in the middle of using it. \nI'll go from 9000 steps to 0 and it won't count any more steps after that \ntill the next day.", "It was a good app for not using much power and counting steps in the \nbackground. Yet for approximately the last 2-3 months it's been acting \nstrange. It has shown that I've taken 27,000 steps on a Wednesday. Turns \nout that it wasn't a one time error. Keeps showing such an unrealistic \nnumber of steps on each Wednesday.", "App is good until you reboot the phone then it adds a random amount of \nsteps to the counter. I just rebooted and the counter went from 23'326 \nbefore to 131'212 after!", "Don't think it works. Because it claims I have completed 176 steps, and I \nhaven't moved all day ðŸ˜’", "Widget doesn't seem to be updating steps for me. (Note 4 cm13)", "Best pedometer app I've had. Been using it for years.", 'Such a small app and soo powerful, should be on every mobile', 'By far the best app of its category!', "The best minimal pedometer. I tried at least 10 other apps including paid ones.  This is the best for those who want a clean interface and simplicity. I love using the widget to always know how many steps I have taken that day.  The widget is a 1x1 size, so doesn't take up much space.", "Update: I have knocked down couple stars for the ugly icon change. Why \nwould you change app's icon after so many years, when user already got used \nto it? Terrible idea, not to mention the ugliness of this new icon... \nOriginal review; I have been using it since I had Nexus 5, so it's been \nawhile through 3 phones by now... and it just works. No fuss no muss, this \nis just one of very few perfect apps out there and Im writing about it just \nbecause I wanted to thank developer for his work.", "Works fine most of the time, but randomly stops counting steps every once in a while. Rebooting the device fixes the issue. Might be a problem with my phone's hardware.", "I was going to give it 5*, however I note that yesterday a bug crept in.
