I WORK AT A SITE STORE AND THIS WOULD BE AWESOME CAUSE ALL OF THE OTHER APPS HERE ARE GARBAGE', "Very nice app, more polished and tasteful than typical unit converter apps. (**Updated to 5 stars since the developer added troy weight units. Thanks Calin!) NEW FEATURE REQUEST: Calin, could you please increase the number of decimal digits, or add a Settings option for this? e.g. 1 troy once = 31.1034768 grams exactly (from the 1959 International Yard and Pound Agreement). Units cuts off a troy once as 31.1035 g, and I'd rather have the exact value, and more digits for the other conversions too.", "Best conversion app hands down. Though I wouldn't mind milliamps and microamps in the current section. EDIT: A weird bug always displays 2 stars instead of 5 when I rate some apps. Sorry. :/", "Really complete, really straightforward. Other than plain mathematical bases, (binary, hexadecimal, etc.) I haven't found a unit that the current version can't convert!

Like many other users who like this app, this would be perfect if currency conversions and customization were added. The updated version has overhauled the look but took away the simplicity and elegance of the older version. It also took away some units e.g. for fuel consumption, it took away L/100 km. So now, at least in my case, some functionality has been taken away. Still a nice app but it does have flaws.   Updated review: The developer responded to our review and it's nice to see that our feedback matters. The updated version restored the units that we liked using or seeing. The app is now very usable and still looks pretty good.", 'Thank you for adding app shortcuts for Nova Launcher üòÉ.
