If I could  I'd rate this more than  once!", "The app fails to move the data to external SD card directory... It's great but i have to uninstall it because of the space it takes.", 'Perfect app for European birds. Lacks only a donate button!', "Absolutely brilliant....sounds, photos, multiple search criteria and languages (including Latin)......just wonderful - pitty that it doesn't appear to be available on the Windows platform at the moment. My favourite app since yesterday!", "Great app, and with the option to dowload sounds and images, you're good to with or without internet. What makes this even better is that you can search in many languages", 'Excellent. Very nice that you can download all pictures and sounds, perhaps this option should be made more clear. Being able to make custom groups of birds (i.e. to prepare trips) would be a nice feature to add. Also, the main interface should be available in other languages', 'A MUST HAVE for new birdwatchrts', 'But you have to download each one.', 'This is the only bird app I have found where you can search bird names in your own language. And that should be at the centre of ALL bird apps - nobody knows what birds are called in other languages than their own! Also, you can download all images and sounds in one big package, and unzip it in the apps folder (about 180 mb). Would like a link to the wikipedia article, or some more info on the birds. Currently, only image, sound, habitat and name shows up...', 'Very good field tool!', "Promising app. What is needed is a way to download all the high res pictures and sounds in one shot. Also, a way to look at all the pics sequentially. Keep the good work up and I'll give you more stars.", 'Very easy to use and the list of birds and related data is impressive ! The pictures are beautiful. My phone is much smaller than a regular guide book. It is possible to download all the larger pictures and sounds in one shot from the wiki (It would be easier directly from the app). It is nice that one can learn the bird name in different languages but I wish I could parameterize which languages listed instead of all 30 of them!', "Didn't work on my note3?"], 'appId': 'fr.ornidroid', 'url': 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.ornidroid&hl=en&gl=us'}
