This was already the case before, i.e., you could not run the game on phones that only support OpenGL ES 1.x, but it wasn't enforced by the Play Store, so you could install the game on a phone not supporting OpenGL ES 2.0 even though opening the game would fail.\r\n* Blurry fonts have finally been fixed (#59). To celebrate this, the main game typography has changed.\r\n* 'Colorblind' mode has been renamed to 'Colorblind mode' to make more clear the purpose.\r\n* The notification and status bar sometimes were not properly hidden in fullscreen mode - #76. This may have been fixed now, or not.\r\n* Removed Platforms API because desktop support was removed.\r\n\r\n## I'm still using Android 2.x and I'm mad\r\n\r\nThis release is not compatible with phones and tablets running Android 2.2, 2.3 and 3.x. Sorry for not being able to provide support for your 7 year old Android version, but the Google Play libraries the GPE version use require Android 4.0 or greater.\r\n\r\nIf you still have such an old operating system, the OSP version will probably work on Android 2.2+, although it has not been tested. Note that changing the `minSdkVersion` property in `app/build.gradle` is required to support Android 2.2.\r\n\r\n## Download the game\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=es.danirod.rectball.android&utm_source=global_co&utm_medium=prtnr&utm_content=Mar2515&utm_campaign=PartBadge&pcampaignid=MKT-AC-global-none-all-co-pr-py-PartBadges-Oct1515-1\"><img alt=\"Get it on Google Play\" src=\"https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/images/apps/en-play-badge.png\" height=\"60\" /></a>"

Future versions will continue adding long-requested features and making small changes to the codebase to make it easier to maintain. No expected dates.\r\n\r\n* Combinations are now unselected as soon as a ball with the wrong color is selected (fixes #56).\r\n* Less score will be given for combinations made using a hint (#61).\r\n* Statistics will now display how many hints have you used (#70).\r\n* More time is now rewarded for better combinations (#72).\r\n* A share button has been added to the Statistics screen (#50).\r\n\r\nAlso I have made a few changes to the development process in order to make release and deployment easier in the future.\r\n\r\n* Dropped support for desktop. Rectball is now mobile first game. I'm doing this because keeping the Java Desktop version in pace with the changes I'm doing in the Android project is hard.\r\n* Google Play Edition is now open source. This means that it is possible to build a version linked against Google SDK. No API keys have been uploaded so the project will fail to build.\r\n* Both Google Play Edition and Open Source Edition will coexist as flavors. Just use releaseGpe or releaseOsp as Gradle tasks when building the project.\r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\n* Game fonts are still blurry - #59.\r\n\r\nPlease report issues at the issue tracker.\r\n\r\nDownload the game for Android here:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=es.danirod.rectball.android&utm_source=global_co&utm_medium=prtnr&utm_content=Mar2515&utm_campaign=PartBadge&pcampaignid=MKT-AC-global-none-all-co-pr-py-PartBadges-Oct1515-1\"><img alt=\"Get it on Google Play\" src=\"https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/images/apps/en-play-badge.png\" height=\"60\" /></a>"

Because who could not love Kotlin, I ask. This will happen first.\r\n   - I would like to add HTML5 support. I don't know it's possible since GWT is a transpiler that requires Java source code, while Kotlin generates Java bytecode. A quick search on the interwebs is suggesting me to go for [TeaVM](http://www.teavm.org/), will give it a try. HTML5 support would make the game run on almost any platform provided it has a web browser.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- dec0b2b - Fixed a bug on the Score actor: when the user reaches 10.000 and the animation pops in, it was adding more score than what it should.\r\n- 4552142 - New font rendering system. Uses BitmapFont instead of Freetype. Freetype does not work on HTML5 so I'm falling back to BitmapFont. Removing the freetype libs and the TTF files reduces the size of the app again.\r\n\r\nReport bugs at the [issue tracker](https://github.com/danirod/rectball/issues).\r\n\r\nDownload the game for Android here:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=es.danirod.rectball.android&utm_source=global_co&utm_medium=prtnr&utm_content=Mar2515&utm_campaign=PartBadge&pcampaignid=MKT-AC-global-none-all-co-pr-py-PartBadges-Oct1515-1\"><img alt=\"Get it on Google Play\" src=\"https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/images/apps/en-play-badge.png\" height=\"60\" /></a>\r\n"

The cleanup and memory management is almost finished and by now the game should be less laggy and more responsible. This patch also introduces lots of bugfixes found previously.\r\n- Android: game state is saved when the game is minimized using Android SavedState Bundle. Therefore, [you shouldn't lose your game again by minimizing the game and restoring it later](https://twitter.com/josecodfacilito/status/658400319253139457).\r\n- Android: added better fullscreen support. Now you can even decide whether you want fullscreen or not.\r\n- Changed e7efd01 - 2x assets have been removed. They were only visible on Mac OS X anyway, so I'm removing them to save more than half a megabyte in space.\r\n- Added #48 - Bonus combinations now have a different color so that you can better know when you have received some extra score because of a large combination.\r\n- Fixed #52 - Fixed a race condition on the Help button that made it give wrong combinations sometimes.\r\n- Fixed #53 - Fixed an infinite loop that could happen sometimes on the Game Over screen.\r\n- Fixed #54 - Android: fixed a bug where the navigation bar wouldn't hide sometimes when restoring the game.\r\n\r\nReport bugs at the [issue tracker](https://github.com/danirod/rectball/issues).\r\n\r\nDownload the game for Android here:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=es.danirod.rectball.android&utm_source=global_co&utm_medium=prtnr&utm_content=Mar2515&utm_campaign=PartBadge&pcampaignid=MKT-AC-global-none-all-co-pr-py-PartBadges-Oct1515-1\"><img alt=\"Get it on Google Play\" src=\"https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/images/apps/en-play-badge.png\" height=\"60\" /></a>\r\n"

Changes:\r\n- Added: new animations for the score and the timer when you do a combination.\r\n- Added: A Hint button. Press it if you don't know which selection to make. Note that Hints aren't free! Asking for help will cost you 5 seconds.\r\n- Added: a share button! It will share a screenshot of your score when you lose. You can share that score with your friends to show them how good you are. The behaviour depends on the OS you are using, though.\r\n  - Desktop (Linux, Mac, Windows): The screenshot will be saved to your computer.\r\n  - Android: it will show you a Share dialog to share the screenshot in WhatsApp, Twitter, Dropbox or actually any app that accepts photos. What you do with your screenshot, is not my business.\r\n- Added: some subtle changes to the UI.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues:\r\n- If you press the Hint button when the time is about to run out (less than 5 seconds), you'll notice that the animation actually makes negative time. You were going to lose, anyway, but that'll be fixed in a patch that will be released in a day or two.\r\n\r\nDownload the game for Android here:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=es.danirod.rectball.android&utm_source=global_co&utm_medium=prtnr&utm_content=Mar2515&utm_campaign=PartBadge&pcampaignid=MKT-AC-global-none-all-co-pr-py-PartBadges-Oct1515-1\"><img alt=\"Get it on Google Play\" src=\"https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/images/apps/en-play-badge.png\" height=\"60\" /></a>\r\n"

In this release the development has focused on fixing most of the bugs you found in Beta 2 in order to make the game more stable.\r\n- Added: some people complained that they didn't know how to play. This has been fixed by adding a tutorial.\r\n- Added: statistics now display infographic data using images and graphs.\r\n- Added: ¡Mirá esto! The game now includes localization for Spanish (Argentina).\r\n- Fixed: some other translations in Spanish have been fixed.\r\n- Fixed: an embarrassing bug where the board would always generate the same combination has been fixed.\r\n- Fixed: pressing the Back key should not unexpectedly close the app again. Instead, you'll be back to the home menu or to the screen you were before.\r\n- Fixed: the game no more resumes if you hide Rectball while the \"leave dialog?\" is displayed (for instance, you press HOME to send a very important SMS and then resume the game to continue playing).\r\n- Fixed: great news for those having their phone set to auto turn off the screen after 15 seconds: the screen should not dim nor turn off while the game is opened. No more turn offs while you are thinking your next combination.\r\n\r\nPlease, report bugs at the [issue tracker](http://github.com/danirod/rectball/issues)!

If you get coredumps on Linux, please download again using the updated download link. Sorry!\r\n\r\nThis is Beta 2. This release has focused on a cosmetic change to make the game look modern by appling a better and more integrated style that isn't finished, however. This is also the last release that is being developed 100% while streaming on LCTV. This doesn't mean that the development is halting, of course, but that the game will be developed faster because now I can work on it more than 4 hours a week in order to finish it faster (which is what we all actually want, right?).\r\n- Added: New look and feel for the game. I know, the game used to look ugly. I changed that, the game has now a completely, fresh and modern look.\r\n- Added: The game now collects local statistics on how you play. You can see these facts on the new Statistics button on the main menu.\r\n- Added: ¡Hola, chicos! The game now can have translations. It has been translated to Spanish.\r\n- Changed: Changed the game over animation. It looks like everybody likes this new animation, so please enjoy.\r\n- Changed: Changed the score from 6 to 4 digits. You wouldn't be able to get that much score, anyway.\r\n- Changed: Some internal changes have been made to make the game faster.\r\n- Changed: Bugs fixed.\r\n\r\nPlease, report bugs at the [issue tracker](http://github.com/danirod/rectball/issues)!

    "body": "Welcome to the first public Beta release of Rectball! Of course you can still access alpha releases if you take a deep look into the source code, but since they are very unstable they are not available for download. Now that the game is in Beta and that the core gameplay aspects are finished, I'll work on the Final 1.0.0 release by making the game beautiful, adding better graphics, improving the Android version with features such as Google Play integration, and fixing lots of bugs.\r\n\r\nPlease, report bugs at the [issue tracker](http://github.com/danirod/rectball/issues)! It's the only way for getting them fixed.\r\n\r\nDownload the game for Android here:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=es.danirod.rectball.android&utm_source=global_co&utm_medium=prtnr&utm_content=Mar2515&utm_campaign=PartBadge&pcampaignid=MKT-AC-global-none-all-co-pr-py-PartBadges-Oct1515-1\"><img alt=\"Get it on Google Play\" src=\"https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/images/apps/en-play-badge.png\" height=\"60\" /></a>\r\nOr use the link below for downloading the game for desktop.\r\n"
