If you have created your own custom items to use alongside the defaults, make sure that they still look good and check their alignment with the new design. The photo below is a comparison between the old layout and new layout. There was some discussion in issue #79 in which @code-schreiber and I decided that the 'new' layout is more aesthetically pleasing.\r\n\r\n![Comparison](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15860949/38778798-c373584e-40b6-11e8-82c5-6395b66d1228.png)\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, I would like to thank @code-schreiber again for updating translations in the library and tidying up the readme.\r\n\r\nFinally, the bundled version of the support library has been updated to 27.1.1 which fixes some Fragment Transactions that you might have encountered on the previous version. (AOSP Issue [74051124](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/74051124))\r\n"

The demo app now has more examples for dynamic objects.\r\n\r\nI've implemented DiffUtil and therefore you should find it less resource intensive to update the list - in fact, it can now be refreshed every second without dropping any frames. A lot of improvements here.\r\n\r\n* getMaterialAboutList() has been renamed to getList() to avoid confusion.\r\n"

    "body": "Lots of behind the scenes changes to make some the new features possible here. The library is now more modular and customisable than it was before which I hope will encourage some pretty unique use cases.\n- **Breaking:** `MaterialAboutItem`s have been moved into a separate package, so be sure to update your imports.\n- Custom items are now possible. This is an advanced feature, however should be relatively simple to implement. Check out the [demo app](https://github.com/daniel-stoneuk/material-about-library/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/danielstone/materialaboutlibrarydemo) to see how it's done. (#31)\n- It is now possible to dynamically update the UI (#33) with `.setMaterialAboutList`\n- A new `ConvenienceBuilder` method to create an address item has been added (#34)\n- Scrolling the toolbar off screen is now made possible by `.setScrollToolbar` (#35)\n\nThanks to @Scrounger, @abiemann, @Rainer-Lang and everyone else who has taken the time to suggest improvements to the library.\n\nPS: If anyone is willing to document these new changes, please get in touch! I only have a limited amount of time - juggling school work and android dev, and obviously I'd rather be coding than writing! Thanks 👍 \n"
