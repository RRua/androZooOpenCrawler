Most alternatives would only have ubuntu run with only it's core functions installed and if you are lucky, You might have access to an ancient variant of the twm window manager that barely works.

Also, just a thought, why not have it start a distro looking like an install of that distro, right? Please send a howto sheet. And put the 127.0.0.1:5704 stuff in the instructions.
