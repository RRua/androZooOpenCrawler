The selection is small but it's changes are complete as I believe can be attained. I have tried many others root & nonroot, and most of the others wont change a small strip towards the top of the screen. I'm sure some of you have noticed it. Calugraphy is my choice. It is Old English, yet streamlined. A nice balance. The best hands down.", "10/10 app, this app offers a lot of beautiful looking fonts. One advantage it has over other apps I use is that it can apply font systemwide. If there's something to improve, then it should be the number of unicode character support font (I have some issues with displaying Vietnamese texts, but they are acceptable).", 'Great app. Simple and unique fonts. Not too many options, but still a great collection. Keep adding good fonts. Just one thing. Can you guys please write font names (main menu) in their own font styles?
