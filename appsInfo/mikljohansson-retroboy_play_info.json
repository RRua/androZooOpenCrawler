Only feature I would wish for would be a synthetic color pxl2000, by using the rgb channels breaking each out separately applying the effect to each channel as monochrome and then recombining the image back to rgb. The idea would be as if you had 3 pxls each with an r g or b filter and then combined thier output into an rgb image', "Great app. No ads. And it even emulates the C64's double width pixels. The only way it could be better is if there were more filters like the Apple II's double hi-res mode.", "4 1 thing it doesn't have the same features that the origenal gameboy camera had like 2 have a double face connected or 2 hands or the bubble feature none of that kinda stuff.", 'How k and white only the other color options are still black and white', "It's not greedy for money at all!", 'A perfect pixel vision app IF it could record video with sound.   I have been trying to find a good retro \'pixel vision\' photo app and came across this one. It surprised me because it has a bunch of retro camera filters including PXL2000 camera, gameboy camera, apple computer and more!   Very authentic reproduction! The app also shoots "video" which is really just an animated gif clip.   My only wish is that this app offered real video recording with sound and frame rate adjustments. Id like to shoot movies and edit them and the current gif video can\'t import into any video editor.', 'This is wonderful. The only bugs are crashes from extended video in higher resolution in some devices, and implementing h.264/.mp4 exporting as well as .gif would be more awesomeness! Thanks developers ‚ò∫', 'Fast and easy to use and understand. I would like some sounds though :) Like a shutter sound and the ability to record in 8-bit.', 'Buena aplicacion para ser gratuita cumple con lo que dice, sin publicidad? Genial.', 'Now I want more filters,  your ideas are awesome :)', 'Love these filters. Really reminds me of graphics from back in the day.', 'thanks for the detailed and up-to-date changelog üëç', 'on Nexus 5X', 'Brings back my memories of growing up with the original game boy.', 'Lots of fun. Simple. Not complex or hard to use.

Thanks!', "I had this on my iPod touch 4th gen, and I'm glad I got something that compares and surpasses it since I got 13 megapixels on my Note 3! Love the GameBoy style camera :)", 'awesome. hope you keep working on it.', "I was looking for a Gameboy Camera and immediately purchased this app. To my surprise, there's plenty of more fun filters to goose from! And you can even edit an image you already have saved as well, which is awesome. Hope to see plenty of more filters, I'll definitely support and spread the word of this awesome app!", "Doesn't work on galaxy s3. Uninstall and refund.", "I think the app could do with the gameboy camera style borders. I'd love to see this become even more authentic looking! I have some influencial friends who would spread this like wildfire if it took pictures that came out exactly as they did on the gameboy camera (similar to 8bit pocket camera on the crappstore)", 'Awesome.  Very fun and cool.  Has many customizable options too.  You can make the pics really look like the real thing or change the resolution and get clearer pics with fantastic effects.  Well worth the money.  App rocks.  I have jelly bean 4.1.1 with a quad core.', 'Hell yeah, an Amstrad CPC effect!  The rest of them are very nice as well, really lovely app...', 'a great application to take some really nice photos with. several sized, several filters and a really good live-view functionality that most camera programs are missing. hope to see some new filters soon!', "It's ok but nothing too exciting and about it.
