Aspects constantly delete themselves while typing or when I'm done and add another aspect underneath it. Stunts have the same issue. If you type something longer than the line it will show what you type but, once you are done typing it only saves the text up to the end of the line with no way to see the rest of the aspect or stunt. Not worth the 20 seconds it took to download.", "This app has a lot of potential, and could be invaluable if it's problems get fixed. As of right now, it only saves secondary aspects (Not High Concept or Trouble). It also does not save character names or descriptions. Skills save fine. Willing to be patient due simply to the vast potential.  Edit: changed my rating to five stars, because the issues, at least on my device (Galaxy Tab E) seem to have been resolved.", 'Usable app. However, if you\'ve edited some skills in skill list, when you try to add new one it glitches and drops everything to default. Also export to pdf and "view without edit" feature would be nice', 'So it seems to work ok. There is a save issue, but I found that hitting the \nsave button 2 or 3 times usually works but I do hope this gets fixed.', "Can not save anything that involves this app. I got this to help keep track of many characters but I can't even save one. This app is poorly managed. Will be getting one star till issues are fixed", "It's handy to have a thing like this on the go, but it kind of needs some polishing up before you can really be charging 99 cents for it. The foremost issue is that oftentimes some information won't get saved, such as the character's names, or its two top aspects, for example.   That aside, other features to focus on moving forward are of course the ability to sync this app with other devices, since this is at its heart an informational reference app. Another important emphasis looks like it will be in expanding data types. What this refers to is things like adding descriptions to each aspect to elaborate upon, usually done to suggest a few ideas for invokes and compels. Stunts might want to be set up in a similar fashion, such that their names can collapse what could often be elaborate descriptions as to what they do. Stress uses up a lot more vertical space than it really needs to, and it would probably be for the best to enable the user to create new stress tracks for more modded games.   Minor details probably include things like being able to label consequence slots with letters to differentiate the specialized physical or mental stress consequences one gains at +5 in the respective skill. Another useful idea might be to create groups underneath a header. For example, on the main Fate Sheets screen, a user may want to organize their characters by genre, or by PCs versus mooks. Users might also find use in organizing aspects or stunts in this manner. It couldn't hurt to future-proof, and it's possible to accomplish these things without cluttering up the screen too much.", "A pretty convenient app that I'll recommend to my friends that prefer to keep track of their character digitally.", 'This app is still having save issues on on my experia X. Appears to require save button twice to track changes. Otherwise is acceptable. Requires an obvious export to Pdf or save to Google drive.', "The app itself would be great but it doesn't save my character sheets. I tried saving my test sheet multiple times but could only get it to keep the character name and skills.", 'Having issues getting the info to save, but outside of that this is still the best fate character sheet app out there.', "Save doesn't work, which makes the app pretty much useless."], 'appId': 'link.standen.michael.fatesheets', 'url': 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=link.standen.michael.fatesheets&hl=en&gl=us'}
