{'title': 'Media Notification', 'description': "MediaNotification is a slightly unstable attempt to create Android O styled media notifications. Please note that this app does not replace media notifications coming from other apps, but it creates new notifications on its own. The most common methods of use are as follows:\r\n\r\nOPTION ONE: Leave the original music player notifications intact. The app will read its data and create a new notification with fully operational album art and media controls. There should not be any issues using the app this way, provided that the 'Use Broadcast Receiver' switch is disabled.\r\n\r\nOPTION TWO: Block all notifications from the music players installed on your phone, and enable the switch at the bottom of the settings menu. The app will then obtain all its information from a BroadcastReceiver, and get the album art from either the external storage (if the song is being played locally) or from the last.fm api. \r\n\r\nOPTION THREE: Somehow install the app on the system partition of your device, and grant it android.permission.UPDATE_APP_OPS_STATS. This is not possible to do from within the app as the UPDATE_APP_OPS_STATS is protected by the application signature. In other words, you will need to compile a new apk with the same signature as the rest of the system apps.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this app is not compatible with every music player on the market. This is simply because there is no way for another app to obtain information from them about the current playing song.\r\n\r\nGitHub: https://goo.gl/iL6fcj", 'descriptionHTML': 'MediaNotification is a slightly unstable attempt to create Android O styled media notifications.

Thanks! 5 Stars deserved.', "THIS IS AMAZING - the app & notification itself work really well, no issues there. The help section is really useful too!   Just would be great to be able to still maintain the notification colours/artwork when the oroginal music notification is blocked   Maybe it'll be possible in the future, but I definitely recommend this solution - 5 stars!", 'Does not work with Spotify.
