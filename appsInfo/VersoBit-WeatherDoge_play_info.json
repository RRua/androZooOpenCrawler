Other than that, though, it's a very DθG3 experience.", "This app is great, but recently the widget stopped working. This is a shame, as the widget is really convenient. App itself still works fine though. This app is good for quickly and conveniently checking the current weather. Also, the doge hides under a table during thunderstorms and that's hilarious. Helpful, funny app, just please fix the widget.", 'I love the widget but it would be nice if it still worked for the US I have entered all the zip codes in my area and all I get is places in s.e Asia and India', "The greatest weather app one could want.
