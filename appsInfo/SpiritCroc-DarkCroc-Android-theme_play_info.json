Enough options to theme the core of aosp but not to much to get confused with all those options. I use it on phh-trebble-aosp 9... it's the perfect companion to it. And it's also open sourced. thanks. PS: I usually don't give 5 stars, so it's earned.", 'Pretty good theme. However there are a few bugs on my aosp-y Moto X4 running Android One Pie. 1. In Digigtal Wellbeing the navbar turns completely black. 2. In the Storage section of the Settings the text that reads "total used of" remains black and is therefore unreadable on the dark background. 3. The notifications from Viber are almost unreadable because the Reply button and the app icon are violet on black.', "I love the dark variant & implementation of it, there are a lot of black themes out there but dark theme is very rare to spot. Got some minor issues but I'll try mailing the dev about it. I'm going to stay on this theme for a while. Nice job!", "Spits out a bunch of errors but works anyway. No previews to see what your phone will look like without fully applying. Can't get the colors I want without either settings submenu headers or lockscreen notifications turning white.", "You need a separate system to even run this app. And the separate system needs to be rooted. I wish all the extra wasn't needed because, the theme looks amazing!", "Nice simple theme, but why can't i choose to leave the accent colors default and most importantly why can't I choose to keep rounded notifications. I really am not a fan for square notifications", 'The best free theme that works great with Aosp experience. Could you please adding support for play store also?
