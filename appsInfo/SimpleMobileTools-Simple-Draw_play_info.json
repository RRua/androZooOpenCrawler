Today I needed to share an image and cover some private text before doing so. I spent ages trying to find a simple image editor that allows erasing or drawing over the text before sharing. After trying a few highly rated image editing apps only to find they all just offer an Instagram level of adding sprites or applying color filters, but no ability to actually edit. I remembered this. Worked 5/5', "Needs fullscreen mode, so that gestures on Android 10 won't be as easily triggered", 'This seriously needs a two finger pan to accompany the zoom function. How is not in there yet?', "Won't draw. FAQ doesn't help, either.", 'easy, handy little app...', 'It seems I cannot share a picture to this app. It can only edit a picture on the disk/storage. For example if I edited a picture in another app, and share the picture (without saving) to this app, it does not work.', "Useless for simple editing images (I just wanted to cover something in the photo). It adds frame around the image with canvas background color. Also you can't even zoom in specific part of image, you can only zoom in the center, so you can't see the sides. Why would you even upload this to the play store? Dude, why??", 'I like the simplicity of this app as i just wanted it for scribbling when i was bored. However there is a really annoying flaw which is: if you accidentally hit the back button on your phone, which is easy to do , you lose any unsaved progress.', "It says I installed the pro version, but its not. It'd exactly the same. Not even the name is different. I really like some of your other releases. Gallery Pro is my favourite. But it seems you put all of your effort Into two or three and dozed off on the rest.", "A remarkably well designed, simple sketch pad. It does everything I want it to do and it's entirely intuitive to use.", "Very light and simple. I'm not sure yet if their are any tools. But an idea could be line and circle tool. Or cursive effects, transparency, layers, stamp making. If you can build it, they will come.", 'I use this to draw on screenshots, but the application either crops the top part of them, or adds white bars to the sides. It would be nice to keep the original picture size when opening picture files. Otherwise, a great application.', "It might not be simpler backend, but a stylus-only mode would sure make my experience simpler. It's a solid, straight up app. Wish more of my world would pursue that paradigm (as I backspace 20 emojis I just typed accidentally....)", "It's excellent app for quick marks/highlights on an image/photo/screenshot to share. To get the fifth star, it needs crop/cut feature to be able to remove unwanted info.", 'WARNING: this is just aweful! And like all this dev\'s apps it ALWAYS RUNS IN BACKGROUND NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I KILL IT! HUGE BATTERY WASTER! WORST: when I "uninstalled" it it only "disabled" but STAYED ON MY DEVICES AND SOMEHOW STILL KEPT OPENNING EVERY SO OFTEN! THAT IS TOO SUSPICIOUS SO I USED ADVANCED FEATURES TO WIPE ALL TRACES FROM MY DEVICES!', 'awesome application with stellar features. It is really simple app as you descibed. customisation is superb. keep it up....', "I think it's an easy app that I use to make quick notes.. just three buttons.. quick and simple .. I like it and works great for me !!", 'No-nonsense sketch tool. Simple and fun to use. Part of an excellent series of apps that are worth the money.', 'Hard to find something that will let you import a pic amd draw on it...for some reason. this app fits the bill and as the name implies, keeps everything nice and simple.', 'Nice and simple but I\'ll never buy your apps. Your original apps I did purchase through "thank you" and then you stop development and start another set. You gonna do that again? I\'m not taking a chance. Thanks for the free app one day offer.', 'What an absolutely fantastic, elegantly simple drawing app, which importantly, does not request any unneeded permissions either. Well done developer!', 'Very usable tool on a tablet. Reasonable simple to use. Does have some ads but not intrusive. Sometimes just use it for saving notes etc. Certainly suits my purposes.', "Great for simple drawings or photo edits. Easiest way to highlight specific buildings on map screenshots that I've found! Happy with my purchase.", "Fabulous drawing tool. Wonderfully versatile and you don't have to be a tech wiz to use it. Totally recommend!", 'Simple and good ... has features to undo, erase, clear and change colors ... the best!', 'For a few pennies I think this app is good fun. It used to be free but I think it is worth supporting this developer!', "It's like the best drawing app ever so when I make videos I'll make drawing videos I can do lots of thing great app so keep up the good work üòÉ", 'Simple, easy and nice, as it should be', 'Easy to sketch and draw quickly and saved very good', "It's good. Sad to see all the haters probably paid by competition to rate your apps poorly, don't let it discourage you :)", 'Good and handy tool, happy with it', 'Make it so that you can zoom everywhere and not just in the middle, good app tho', 'Great for quick doodles.', "I use it a lot and I like it, now that it's working again.", 'Simple and works great.', 'Good app for doodles.', 'Best for doodling fast', 'Great work boss.. Working as mentioned.
