Reinstalling & rebooting didn't improve things. Strange. The alternative daap-client app called SharePlay works fine though.", 'Totally not intuitive. It would be so difficult to learn I may as well learn to program and make my own music program. Not what a phone app is supposed to be.', 'Uses only the resources to stream the song nothing more. I was impressed very much with this app I used this app when I was cutting the grass and I have a big yard, I have wireless repeater about mid way. And it was switching between AP and this app did not shudder one bit. Even if my signal was quite weak. It uses only the amount of data of however big that single song is.', "Android 5 on Samsung 4 broke it. It connects to server and it will  download, but it doesn't  stream.

It still really great in 2015. I can stream my music to my car radio while I'm driving using a bluetooth connection. The DAAP interface is a lot safer to use while you're driving than google music for example.", "This is the best DAAP player I've found for my phone. Unfortunately, all that means is that, unlike all the other players, it works once in a while, instead of never.", 'This app is one of only a few on the market that works with the DAAP proticall. Its allso nice and small. And runs in the background. Even when browsing the web.', 'I love this app and using daily to access my Daap server.

I might actually buy a second hand HTC desire from ebay and just use that as my media bridge. I gave my soundbridge so much time and effort but the wireless technology they have used is so poor, I just can't handle the connection issues I have experienced over the past 5 years.  The android wireless on the HTC desire is flawless, and time will tell whether this client can maintain the connection to my router and firefly or not, but seems pretty good so far.  I'm a java developer and I'm always amazed that you guys have time to build stuff like this and offer it for free!  Well done and thanks.", "Nice app!  I've been using it with Rhythmbox and I've found a couple of oddities, but since Rhythmbox crashed a couple of times, I don't think is DAAP Media Player fault.", 'I installed Firefly (forked-daap) on my Ubuntu computer, edited the /etc/forked-daap.cfg, and opened port 3869 on my router and boom!
