If it doesn't work, just make sure to clear cache because it may not pick up recent app installs or updates", "Good App. I really enjoy using it. How about an update please? There is a need for extra app sizes. Also need some more sorting options, ie another page to sort by type, SMS another with favourites, etc. Let's talk please.", 'very good! i like it a lot! fast, good overview, no bugs yet detected! a few more options for app sort would be great like recent and recent plus usage. and more options for icon display... great app, thanks a lot!', "great app faster to search your apps in case you have more than 60 of them installed like me . you need to wait for some while when you install a new app as fastapp won't be able to index it immediately.", 'very nice one but i needed the search box to appear at the bottom , there is no option to customise thst unfortunately. pls look into the possibility and incsn keep this. else this is of no use to me on OnePlus 7 which comes with a search in app drawer already', "It,s very Usefull !!! When my phone is error , i can't see app . But i can see playstore . I download this then set the theme as default. I can see all my app. Thank You FAST App Search Tool", 'Awesome app but please add T9 mode also. Thanks.', 'Very helpful quick search for finding that one certain app on a crowded device.

Two suggestions-...1_ it doesn't detect a newly-installed app instantly (maybe would detect later but didn't check). I have to force stop it or clear off from memory to make it detect..2_it doesn't show shortcut on home screen, detects only main app's icon. .. One more_ when icons are sorted by installation time, it does so in ascending order, it should do so (or should provide option for both) in descending order.", "This is easily the best app search tool I have found. Admittedly, all it really does is take the Search Apps text box and repackages it into a simple icon and adds some features, but that is very handy. It offers a simple user experience. It displays and searches through all the apps on your device. You can set it up so that it displays a lot of very small app icons. I've set mine to display the maximum (105 applications on a single page). You can set it to either have a keyboard hidden until you use it or open automatically depending on how you want to open your apps. It can be set to launch apps automatically. And it closes automatically once you've opened an app (i.e. it doesn't continue to run in the background). Theoretically, you can have a home page with this one app on it and still get to everything. There is no lag, and there are no ads. This is as close to using a folder-less system for apps as you can get. And I almost forgot to mention, it's very FAST.", "Has huge potential but sorting apps by usage doesn't work as forgets usage sort order & randomly sorts unused apps to top. Search sometimes doesn't list apps when searching or after app installs (force stop temporarily fixes this). Otherwise has great search & function as a launcher. Future improvements could include option to increase/decrease an app's sort order, arrow navigation keys (helps select apps without reaching for top of screen), hidden apps list, & app-locking.", 'I m using lenovo a7000 running marshmellow....i was facing issues when i was using lenovo launcher ,huge battery drain was tgere....but at last i have debloated it and installed your launcher and my battery doesnt drain much now....i also has 30% battery damage in my phone.....so i just think off lite apps which use less resources when compare to others....thanks for being part of my apps list....thanks developers for developing this app....', 'KIWIX APP IS NOT VISIBLE .
