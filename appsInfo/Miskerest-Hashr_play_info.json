I guess when everyone else sets the bar this low, it's OK to have ads? \nAnyway, this one DOES support SD cards and USB drives properly so it's got \nthat going for it. It, however, joins the crowd in not knowing the concept \nof a file with multiple hashes (think piping the output of md5sum), you \ninstead have to paste in each hash manually. Tedious. (Yes, this *can* be \nimplemented with the new file access API.) The UX is also a little bizarre: \nThe current file name is not displayed, and selecting a new file does not \nclear the previous hash result.", 'Hope this app will not dead like others checker did.Simple and Cool.', 'This is an Excellent app.Simple and Works Perfectly...Would hash Again !!', 'Giving updates on the same version number too frequently without any improvements in the app. Change the version number first for updates.

I love the simplicity of the app as well as the fact that it is open source. It does exactly what it is supposed to do, efficiently and effectively!  Equally noteworthy is the developer behind this great app. My initial review reported a bug I had uncovered. The developer replied just a few minutes later! Amazingly, an update fixing the problem was published later that same afternoon! That level of support is truly impressive.  (p.s. Thanks for the mention in the changelog!)', 'WOW ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!! First off "I DON\'T USUALLY LEAVE REVIEWS ON ANYTHING". One of the most simple checksum apps I\'ve found. Very simple, very easy and very efficient. WOW. Had fingers crossed on first boot that it would be decent and boy did I underestimate it.
