I can use this app to convert otherwise decent recipes into usable ones.", 'Terrible app. Waste of time. When you select eg. 1 US cup of olive oil and if gives you the default conversion , when you select what you would like the conversion to be the app changes your original input; so 1 cup changes to something else.
