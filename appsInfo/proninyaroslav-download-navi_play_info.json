This app had the most issues. It would get frequent 404 errors from the download links. Those same links worked fine w/ the other apps. It also struggled w/ download speeds. 3 minute downloads in the others, took 15-30mins in this app. It hasn't been updated in a few months, that makes me wonder if its abandoned.", 'Works pretty well and gives good speed. Just one suggestion please remove that delete task button from the right side and just give only that long pressing way', 'It works perfectly well...In the latest update you added in-app browser.In that please add tabs option and also add an exit browser option.', "open-source, ads free download manager, hope it stays like this or if adding ads, just non intrusive type of ads. Edit: the UI is also AMAZING, Im in love!!!! Edit2: remove one star for attention, can't be selected as an download manager for apps (for example Via Browser), ADM can be selected but Navi can't, maybe feature not implemented yet? will keep using ADM while waiting for reply.", 'Finally, it works like butter. Just choosing number of pieces should be in settings, and recent folder locations should be remembered. 3 stars untill then', 'Great app. I wish it had an extension in Firefox to launch automatically instead of needing to copy the links first, then paste them in... Or have it monitor the clipboard for files like some other apps do...', 'Thanks for the app I like the design of it but it misses some important options like "refreshing the link " when the download is interrupted. I hope you add this option soon', 'very happy with the tool, found it on xda love the clipboard option would be Great to: - skip add dialog completely - remember previous download folder - have a batch download option (e.g. paste many links and create downloads automatically)', "When you search a download manager, the play store will give you all the useless full of ads download manager results. Navi is by far the best for me moreover it's open source. The simplest! Navi deserves 5+ rating.", 'Needs a lot of improvement, Android 9.0 pie notification is a mess. Also looks like the developer has abandoned this app. Sad to see that developers create excellent apps then left it as it is.', 'The Download Manager i was looking for, but scrolling through app drawer is a bit laggy and also the scr resolution looks to big on the home screen.', 'I got into the app and downloaed it and it said failed and it kept popping up the support panel', "Almost everything I download doesn't work.
