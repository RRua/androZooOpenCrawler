The only thing I hate is that there is no option to turn on suggestions. Fix this and it gets 5 stars from me. Another suggestion is to start the search field in the center of the screen since most phones are so big and reaching to the top takes two hands. Dark mode is great too!', 'More widget options like curved edges would be really nice. Overall a good alternative to Google search widget.', 'Completely and utterly without pretense, this app does exactly what I wanted and needed. It is exactly what it says it is. Even if all you want to do is use Google Search, this app circumvents all that added, useless fluff (and giant bubble rounded edges) and takes you right to the results, in your preferred browser. Fantastic.', "Nice just wanted a simple clean search widget that isn't connected to any other apps. I like the zero special permissions, my browsers already have too much access. Thanks for this dev!", 'Does exactly what it says. This is a really good option if you want to have a widget for a non-google search engine on your homescreen. It is also open-source, which is a huge plus.', 'What I was looking for. A simple widget to make fast duck duck go searches and whatcha the result in Firefox. And it is GPL! :) Thanks!', 'Showing that there is no place holder for the search query in your custom search engine UNABLE TO SEARCH DUE TO THIS MESSAGE', 'Exactly what I was looking for. A simple, no BS search bar widget that uses the engine I want and shows the results in my default browser of choice. A+', 'Kudos for the simple, effective idea. But it only shows and uses Yandex!
