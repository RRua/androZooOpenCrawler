Only gripe I have is, I wish i could make the font bigger. I usually use this on my tablet from a distance of about 6ft away. It'd be nice to be able to size it up then it'd be perfect. :D Uses your FFZ and BetterTTV emotes you have already. EDIT: Just checked the app out again. They added a font size adjuster. It's awesome. :D 5 Stars.", "It's a great app! I have to think hard of what i would like to see in this app, it makes my twitch widepeepoBlanket experience so amazing. Things that would be cool, a highlight on the tab witha new message... PepoThink great app :)", 'Great app, was having the problem where it would not connect and managed to solve it by loggin in again because for some reason it thought my phone was a new device and was asking for a verification code, if anyone is having a similar problem do what I did. Keep up the good work developer some more quality of life and optimization and this app is close to perfect.', "An app that save batteries. Expect 3-4X more battery life of the official Twitch app in chat only mode. I use it when my computer show the stream and i'm the bed with my phone for chatting. Very apreciated. I would like 3 things to see in near future : Channel points, list of all viewers and moderator fonctions to be able to moderate.", "Would be worth 5 stars, if it didn't crash every 5 minutes :)", 'Probably the best stand alone twitch chat app. My only feature request would be the ability to turn off the emote suggestions.

But it's a great app for what it is and for what it's trying to be. Also, is there any way we could change the color of the text to white instead of grey?", "Does what it says but it has extremely high battery usage and no option to save channels for quick access. It's kind of a hassle typing the channel names every time. Multiple channels seem to use more battery so I can't just leave them all running. No big deal.", 'Fantastic app! Really useful, any thoughts of adding built in chat translation? Using web translation trying to translate everything (username) alters the correct translation. This would be a great feature. Thank you for such a great app.', "Love it and it's easy to use", "It's really great and one of the best apps out there not like the other apps that either doesn't have bttv or doesn't show your subbed emotes, but the biggest problem with it is there is no, (recent used emotes) button, you have to go and look for the emote every single time, and there is no chat customization like how big it is and other stuff", 'Best there is.
