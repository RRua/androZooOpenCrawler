It would be more intuitive to put it under the settings menu, though', 'Easy to add multiple cities and the weather data by city is an added bonus!', 'Hey, It is nice to using the app, convenient and user friendly !! But be clarified that the name of the city Hong Kong is incorrect, it should be " Hong Kong" / "Hongkong" instead of "Honggong" , please modify thanks, otherwise is an good app!!', 'Was 5 stars. Lowered to 3. Before I could see Oklahoma, Florida, Thailand and Japan on one screen.(1 city from each) Now for the 4th one (Tokyo), I have to scroll down each time. Highly inconvenient. Might delete to look for another app now.', 'Good,but i would prefer you indicate the temperature in degree celcius instead of farenheit for easy understanding', 'It is nice to be able to add multiple locations. Problem when you have 2 locations the 2x2 size cuts off the temperature of the 2nd location. You have to go to 2x4 to show the temperature but that wastes space on the screen. I wish we could size it to fit the information and not stuck with 2x2,2x4, 4x2,etc.', 'Excellent thank you great to know weather conditions in places around world where family and friends live', 'Great app, customizable, dev still updating and improving. Update: app now sends constant, pretty much daily notifications from the dev. Just now, it\'s "check out world clock and weather\'s Facebook page!" Uh, no. App needs to just shut up and show time and weather. Gonna delete if muting notifications doesn\'t work. Also, when I switch back to home screen, app widget is slow to display now, no change on my end. Just shows as a solid color before refreshing itself. New issue, very annoying.', "Well it's nice to see the times in the cities that I will be visiting but the weather keeps dropping off. Sometimes I can uninstall the app and when I reinstall my selection of cities is still there, otherwise I have to reload them. The weather info is there and then a few days later it's gone. Can this be fixed? Well, the weather information still keeps disappearing after a couple of days so I have reduced the stars to two. Please fix this and I will give it 5 stars. Still not working.....", "Like the app, and would rate higher if not for issue, travel quite often but the issue I have is my widget always has at least two different countries and the time never updates unless I resize the widget. If I open app it's fine, even if I refresh the time on widget stays the same unless I resize it. Running Android 10.", 'Great world clock app. Wonderful interface and controls. Easy to use. A lot of content', "Time updates on Galaxy S7 (just installed). It's minimalist (2x1) and I can make the bkgnd transparent (gray), so that's nice. Wish I could turn off weather for a 2x1 widget, though, but otherwise I like it. Thanks!", 'Great app but now trying to update and its slow to download on playstore? When we open the app it says update then proceed to download in playstore but its just spins and spins and does not open your app to download? Can you fix the issue so we can complete update?', 'Very helpful app if you need to compare time and weather in different cities. I talk to friends worldwide and I can immediately see their local conditions.

Can compare multiple countries with different timezones.', "Can't add the cities as separate blocks. Blocks also too small...", 'I love this app. I sent an email to ask them to add a town for me and it was done the next day. Very handy app.', 'World clock and weather app is good widget. Recent one is really stable. Best world clock app in the playstore', 'This is a disgusting & pathetic app, as it has never worked.
