    "body": "## About the project\r\n\r\nDAnnouncer has been my course work for Tampere University of Applied Sciences Android programming course. The application will be released in Google Play later today.\r\n\r\nI wanted to create this app because I absolutely love Discord and I would have loved to have some kind of tool to post announcements with advanced embeddable stuff (this is not possible with a normal user account without breaking Terms of Service). Due to other things I had to prioritize over this project, unfortunately I had no time to implement the embed data stuff. I'd have loved that feature, I also know other people who would have loved it. But I didn't have time to implement it.\r\n\r\nThe app will be released under my university of applied sciences's account so I have no plans to add the embeddable data support. I'd love to revisit this topic again sometime in the future, continue the development then, and maybe release a new app under my personal Google Play account. That won't be anytime soon tho.\r\n\r\n## Release 3\r\n\r\nFinal release of the application.\r\n\r\nApk file is located at /app/release/.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n- Webhooks can be saved to phone memory"
