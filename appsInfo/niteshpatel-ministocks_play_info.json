Probably, source of the data not properly updated.", 'This app worked fine before, but now it is not updating stock prices every 30min as I have instructed it to do. It sometimes takes days before updating. I am now using GalaxyS10, but earlier I had S7 where it somehow worked fine.', 'Nice widget. Automatically updates during weekdays, has capacity to view cryptocurrencies, and open source! Bugs are usually fixed in a reasonable time', 'Excellent. Exactly what I was hoping to find, and more: something to display a few stock tickers, real-time, without having to click on it. On top of that it includes a nice set of options. Would be happy to pay the author a few bucks for it. Re: those who say it stops updating prices, I have found if my phone is set to battery saver mode it blocks the widget, even if you try to update it manually. So, that might be the problem they experienced.', 'Worked great only for a short time. Hasn\'t been accurate or current since "the upgrade" and this happens regularly- it\'s unusable as is.

I've used this for years, however recently the data is out of date", "The application doesn't auto-update stock price... otherwise it's a good application. Suddenly, it stopped working ðŸ˜”", 'This app is simple and functional. I wish the app supported tracking multiple positions in the sam stock separately in the widget. I can only figure out how to set a single price for each symbol. This seems strange because I can have multiple records of the same symbol. I have different concerns with different positions within the same stock.', 'Great app. I would like to see two decimal places on the daily percentage change view. In the future, it would be great to have a interday stock or index chart widget.', 'Have been using this app for over a year now and simply love it. Straight forward setup, has the most essential options and just works like a charm. Keep up the great work.', "Just says Loading Data and does nothing. Clicking on the widget does nothing. Manually opening the app from the list gives you a message but doesn't let you configure anything. Doesnt seem to work at all.", '4 stars for now. I wish currency is added in near future. Thank you.', 'Awesome - I wanted a resizable widget that could display multiple stock tickers within a single widget, and this works perfectly.
