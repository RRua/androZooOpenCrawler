I used it for long days. But recently I have watched something unusual. I am using postpaid number. So counting of sent message is very much important for me for my billing purpose. On last day I found that this message counter is showing 3 messages extra, while I am sure that I have not sent those extra 3 messages. In fact other message counter app is also showing the correct statistics. What may be the reason? Please look into the matter and solve it.  Additional information: I have received 3 OTP related message on that day in my inbox. Can these be wrongly reflected as sent messages?', 'Very easy to use and really helpful for me. It works on any messaging apps. Loved it.', 'app counting sms properly for saved contacts only and not unknown numbers sms. As well no count for success or failed delivery messafes.', "well i know i have sent 1 sms today and this shows 38. so either the App isn't accurate or my operator JIO is doing something wrong..", "Doesn't work.. asking for downloading another app from another appstore", 'idiot app... no working.just wast of time.', "Doesn't work, just wants me to download from another app store", "Can't download it!!!", 'does this app count a messenger messages?', 'What I wanted!!!

Edit : Just tried it, and it does count by thread, can you do anything about this feature please ?", "this use to work but doesn't work anymore. I sent 118 messages yesterday and sent a further 200 today. and yet it still says 118.  well be uninstalling app. as its still not been fixed.. very very bad app..", 'Used this app it is not that good starts in the middle of a texting cycle so trying to keep track was impossible as the date for accuracy was not there.
