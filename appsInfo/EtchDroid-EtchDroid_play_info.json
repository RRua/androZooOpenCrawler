You need to boot from legacy (not UEFI), keep a note of that, and you are good to go. Installed Ubuntu successfully. Go with it.', "Nice app, it did it's job but a problem is that it is running in background with that notification and on some phones that are aggressively optimising the battery are pausing the app multiple times unless I keep the app open or I do some tweaks about battery optimisation. Most of the people don't know this and time is lost. If there was a button or something to ask if I want to run the app in the background with a notification or if I wanted to keep it on would be great.", "Works just as it should! +Maybe even faster than flashing on a PC, yet remaining reliable... Would definitely recommend this to those who lack a PC to create an installation media for their only existing empty PC that has no OS, but yet still have an Android device with OTG support & a pendrive... I really enjoy using this flash tool! So huge thanks! I wish the developers success in their careers & luck in life! <3 Love your's truly & sincerely, Joonatan / JohnSco Music / Geometry Dash P0SITIV3", "Worked like a charm to help me attempt to fix my Ubuntu installation using boot-repair-disk, and when it didn't work (because I royally screwed up the partition tables, not EtchDroid's fault) I was able to wipe the LiveUSB with a single click with Android and install systemrescuecd with EtchDroid. The fact that it doesn't even require root makes it extra special, and it saved my rootless ass. Thank you, dev! Very cool!", "Thanks for making such beautiful app. Very uaeful for making bootable pen drive / sd card for installing windows linux. Its very fast and main thing is that it doesn't require rooted mobile. Also there are no advertisements in between. Kindly add option for making bootable pen drive for windows also (for unrooted mobile). Very nice app... 🙂", 'Very useful app.👍 Successfully written Ubuntu iso file into a USB drive. A request to developer to decrease the writing time as it takes too long than normal. Also to support windows iso image.', "It's really work I didn't expect it before using i have try many os like Phoenixos , Android_x86os ,remixos etc . But some of them not supported to my laptop ,I can only run Android_x86 os in my laptop , with the help of this software . Thank you so much etch droid team.", "Many apps claim to write bootable USB from ISO file (w/o root), but this is the only one I've found that works. If you haven't found a solution yet, give this app five minutes of your time & you'll be on your way.", 'Works great and faster than my PC somehow.. I have a PC w SSD and the works, but this image writer (both .omg & .iso) is blazing fast!, thanks for the free software!', "I like EtchDroid. I didn't understand why Windows is not supported. I mount windows iso file, then copy paste all files inside it into a vfat drive. It's works. please add an additional row like u added for apple to create windows bootable USB. It will just make everyone's work easier.", 'This app worked! Wasted a lot of time on ISO 2 usb. This app really helped me in this quarantine. I had no other option to repair my system.', "It was very useful to install Ubuntu as I don't have any other pc to make the usb as a bootable device.thabks for the wonderful app.the transfer speed was extremely fast.", "Works wonders for installing Ubuntu/Linux through a USB Drive. Downloaded the Linux .iso file to my android, then flashed it onto the USB stick through this app. Now I'm here to leave the 5 star review. Спасибо/ Thanks for making this!", "First of all, the tool does what it says. Clean interface, all perfect. Stick wasn't bootable due to my new computer only booting from GPT formatted drives. That's why i only gave four stars (tried later in vmware stick boots there), even though it isn't the devs fault that Acer released such a crappy bios. Please add support for formatting as gpt!", 'Thank u so much, I have only one laptop and it had was in the grub rescue mode, I tried fixing it but no luck. Finally I found this app to make bootables without a laptop. You are a true life saver. Thank you so much :)', "Truly work! I just made lubuntu bootable usb drive from android using this app. Please make sure to not use this app for windows operating system as its won't work for it. The app would work with any linux distro.", "Thanks, I installed a temporary linux Os using this software then Installed woeusb/winusb and then installed windows from that Pc. This app helped me a lot but please add an sd card option, that wouldn't be much hard.", 'Does what it say. Used it for Linux Mate 32 bit as mine was corrupted and unable to open my machine. Downloaded the ISO file from linux official site and made a live bootable USB from Etchdroid. Super easy and effective. Thanks team.', 'WOW. Saved my life! Heads up, this will not work for windows 10, I used linux and it worked first try!', 'I used this app after using this application my flash drive is showing write protected and not formating and the memory card which contain the iso file also corrupted when cobnected to pc and also showing write protected i any fix available for my flash and sd drive', 'Done what it say, No ads. Great GUI. Simple to use. Not just like other apps that shows stupid frustrating ads right in front your face this app stand alone from crowd. Great job guys. I really appreciate your work. Just keep going. Make great apps like these. Thanks guys:) See u next time. Usually I dont write reviews on apps but these app make me to do so. simple,powerful,usefull,lite make an app at top But it works only with linux distr(s) and not able to make bootable windows usb -2 stars...', "Awesome app! Great job Devs for making it non root.👍 Its the only app i have yet that can use ISO files od linux distros and perfectly write into flash drive.. It is useful when u don't have a CD drive on a new pc or you dont have a Windows Installation Disk. We can use this to boot into tiny live linux distros distros and make a Windows Installation Flashdrive to install windows to a new HDD using some tools and methods.. I did it ..", 'Tried using it for a few distros including linux mint, ubuntu and puppy linux. Mint and ubuntu were corrupted, got stuck when try to boot with several compiler errors despite trying to write several times with multiple sticks. Puppy linux did write correctly though and worked for what I needed it for (transfering files on a non working OS) The writing process took awhile due to muĺtiple crashes and errors but it all finished eventually', 'Worked 100%.Tested: Samsung note 9, android 9, linux mint cinnamon. Solution: flight mode, open etchdroid, pick the iso, pick the usb drive, write to usb, finished writing, ignore "issue with usb drive" or any, plug out usb drive, done. Duration: 3:34min. No permissions, no ads, super fast. Big thank you to the Author! Regards from Europe!', "Hi, it's been working great until i updated to Android 10. Now it freezes randomly when trying to write an image to usb. Realme 5 pro", 'awesome, I uninstalled Windows 10 from my HP Stream 14 laptop because it was slow and this helped me create a bootable usb.', "LifeSaver! Excelent Job! Bravo!... Thankyou so much. Here is the thing, 1. Reckless me wasn't build CD/USB recover 2. I install Ubuntu and delete/format it on Windows mode 3. Basically if I dont back up any flashable files, I cant fix the Windows boot. Then I found you, I download Boot-Repair-Disk and create it using this App. It's work 100%, I was skepting at the begining. Haha", "The best ISO writer available on android... Its like rufus in android... But, only supports linux installation... Even though its good, if your machine runs out of operating system and you don't have a pc to make bootable USB drive like me...", 'My windows os was totally gone nuts. Had my online examination next. Due to lockdown I was unable to take my laptop to the care. Already lost my one pendrive while making it bootable for windows 10 using different application. But then Etchdroid came to my resuce......you just saved my ass 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏thank you so much.', "Worked! Flashed Ubuntu 20.04 using Pixel 3A w/no root. Can't recall seeing a single ad. Thanks so much!", 'Amazing app. Had no problem installing linux on my PC using the bootable usb created from this app. Thank you', "Update s10 rooted on android 10 works 1st time, perfectly - The only 1 that makes a boot USB for arch time after time. Yes you have to restart sometimes but I fine if you don't touch the phone at all but make sure the screen stays on it work. Latest version total tail v1.3.3 from github work strait away", 'Works fine. Easiest way to flash a usb. No need of a laptop or desktop. Good job.👍👍 I tried linux and android images and it worked. Both images are lighter than windows.So i hope it may works fine for windows.Its worth a try.', 'Quick and easy! Support for Windows would be nice but unlike ISO 2 USB, EtchDroid declares this upfront. Thank you.', "Worked perfectly, couldn't get iso2usb to work after several attempts gave up and this app worked seamlessly. Thanks", 'Does what says. Got in grub escape mode after removing dual boot without any live installation usb. Ordered OTG adaptor, downloaded boot repair iso, easily flashed in pd and boom laptop back to normal.', "Saved my day few times. Wish it could do windows iso's. But 5 star for doing perfectly what it meant to do.", "Formated my USB drive with fat32 and tried to use this app to rip a Windows 10 LTSC iso image to it as it's too large to copy directly to a fat32 volume. For whatever reason Android still doesn't support exfat. It copied files and claimed success, but when plugged into my windows 7 PC the USB stick had no recognized file system. Will update this review if I get this app to work. I'm on the Pixel 3a with Android 10. Update, tried twice more and this app cannot properly right a windows filesystem", 'A life saving app when the laptop is dead as said in the description. Really thanksfull And a advice for the next update. Please change the file finding ui/system', 'Thanks! I was happy that i can finally use my dead computer that i broke this quarantine.
