Android 7 on a Samsung tab S2. Hope you guys can fix.', "NEVER has any app annoyed me as much for so long. The back button never does what you'd expect any responsive app to do. If you open an image from imgur in the middle of a long thread good luck going back to where you were in the comments before clicking that image. The menus are confusing, been using the app for two years and I just failed to find how to share a thread. This was the last drop. This is my first star review. tl;dr; Go download the real reddit app.", "This app is still good, but its suffered a bit from Reddit updates that have pushed past what its capable of since i first got it. Reddit messages popups constantly with each thread click, barraging the user to switch to their own native app, and Reddinator seems unable to stop them. Likewise, ad popups now harass through the app, whereas they didnt used to be able to. It's still preferable to the Reddit app, but i cant help but wish the developer could keep up with it. I still love it though", 'The most useful widget to keep up with all aspects of the world, including world news and local issues to all of your particular interests.

I tried looking for a better widget but it is still one of the best for customization yet the this issue is annoying.', "Is there a Mac version of this?

It's ugly for sure, but i love the content.", 'Great app, definitely the best Reddit widget available on the play store', 'This thing works fantastically-- galaxy s8+ edge', 'Love the widget!

The only downside I have with it is when you up/down vote and when you load more posts, it scrolls all the way back to the top.
