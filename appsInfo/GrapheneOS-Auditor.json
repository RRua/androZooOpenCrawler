Android developer previews aren't supported since the hardware verified version is set to a placeholder value. The device performing verification (Auditor) just needs to be any Android 7.0+ compatible device with a camera.\r\n\r\n1. press Auditor on the device that will be verifying the Auditee\r\n2. press Auditee on the device that's going to be verified\r\n3. point the camera of the Auditee at the QR code on the Auditor to read the challenge\r\n4. tap the QR code on the Auditor to advance ahead (if you do this too early, you can press back)\r\n5. point the camera of the Auditor at the QR code on the Auditee to read the attestation\r\n6. view verification of the attestation results\r\n\r\nAn Auditor can verify any number of different Auditee devices. It shows a fingerprint and the first / last verification time in successful paired attestation results. An Auditee can be verified by any number of Auditors but there will be a different fingerprint for each unique pairing rather than the same fingerprint shown on each Auditor for the same Auditee.\r\n\r\nTo set up regularly scheduled remote verification via the remote attestation service:\r\n\r\n1. create an account on https://attestation.app/ from a separate device\r\n2. press the menu button in the app\r\n3. press the 'Enable remote verification' action in the menu\r\n4. scan the account QR code displayed on https://attestation.app/\r\n5. configure an alert email address to receive alerts if the device fails to provide valid attestations in time\r\n6. refresh https://attestation.app/ to view the initial attestation result"

Supported devices:\r\n\r\n* BlackBerry Key2 (BBF100-6 model)\r\n* BQ Aquaris X2 Pro\r\n* Google Pixel 2\r\n* Google Pixel 2 XL\r\n* Google Pixel 3\r\n* Google Pixel 3 XL\r\n* Huawei Honor 7A Pro (AUM-L29 model)\r\n* Huawei Honor 10 (COL-L29 model)\r\n* Huawei Honor View 10 (BKL-L04 and BKL-L09 models)\r\n* Huawei Mate 10 (ALP-L29 model)\r\n* Huawei Mate 20 Pro (LYA-L29 model)\r\n* Huawei P20 Pro (CLT-L29 model)\r\n* HTC EXODUS 1\r\n* HTC U12+\r\n* Nokia 6.1\r\n* Nokia 7 Plus\r\n* OnePlus 6 (A6003 model)\r\n* Samsung Galaxy Note 9 (SM-N960F and SM-N960U models)\r\n* Samsung Galaxy S9 (SM-G960F, SM-G960U and SM-G960W models)\r\n* Samsung Galaxy S9+ (SM-G965F, SM-G965U, SM-G965U1 and SM-G965W models)\r\n* Sony Xperia XA2 (H3113, H3123 and H4113 models)\r\n* Sony Xperia XZ1 / XZ1 Compact (G8341 and G8342 models)\r\n* Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact (G8441 model)\r\n* Sony Xperia XZ2 (H8216 model)\r\n* Sony Xperia XZ2 Compact (H8314 and H8324 models)\r\n* Xiaomi Mi A2\r\n* Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite\r\n* Xiaomi POCOPHONE F1\r\n\r\nIt cannot be bypassed by modifying or tampering with the operating system (OS) because it receives signed device information from the device's Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) or Hardware Security Module (HSM) including the verified boot state, operating system variant and operating system version.

It will verify that the device is running the stock operating system with the bootloader locked and that no tampering with the operating system has occurred. It will also detect downgrades to a previous version. Supported devices:\r\n\r\n* BlackBerry Key2 (BBF100-6 model)\r\n* BQ Aquaris X2 Pro\r\n* Google Pixel 2\r\n* Google Pixel 2 XL\r\n* Google Pixel 3\r\n* Google Pixel 3 XL\r\n* Huawei Honor 10 (COL-L29 model)\r\n* Huawei Honor View 10 (BKL-L04 and BKL-L09 models)\r\n* Huawei Mate 10 (ALP-L29 model)\r\n* Huawei P20 Pro (CLT-L29 model)\r\n* HTC EXODUS 1\r\n* HTC U12+\r\n* Nokia 6.1\r\n* Nokia 7 Plus\r\n* OnePlus 6 (A6003 model)\r\n* Samsung Galaxy Note 9 (SM-N960F and SM-N960U models)\r\n* Samsung Galaxy S9 (SM-G960F and SM-G960U models)\r\n* Samsung Galaxy S9+ (SM-G965F, SM-G965U, SM-G965U1 and SM-G965W models)\r\n* Sony Xperia XA2 (H3113, H3123 and H4113 models)\r\n* Sony Xperia XZ1 / XZ1 Compact (G8341 and G8342 models)\r\n* Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact (G8441 model)\r\n* Sony Xperia XZ2 (H8216 model)\r\n* Sony Xperia XZ2 Compact (H8314 model)\r\n* Xiaomi Mi A2\r\n* Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite\r\n\r\nIt cannot be bypassed by modifying or tampering with the operating system (OS) because it receives signed device information from the device's Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) including the verified boot state, operating system variant and operating system version.

Android developer previews aren't supported since the hardware verified version is set to a placeholder value.

It will verify that the device is running the stock operating system with the bootloader locked and that no tampering with the operating system has occurred. It will also detect downgrades to a previous version. Supported devices:\r\n\r\n* Google Pixel 2\r\n* Google Pixel 2 XL\r\n* Huawei Honor View 10 (BKL-L04 model only)\r\n* Nokia 6.1\r\n* Samsung Galaxy S9 (SM-G960F and SM-G960U models)\r\n* Samsung Galaxy S9+ (SM-G965F, SM-G965U1 and SM-G965W models)\r\n* Sony Xperia XA2 (H3113, H3123 and H4113 models)\r\n* Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact (G8441 model only)\r\n\r\nIt cannot be bypassed by modifying or tampering with the operating system (OS) because it receives signed device information from the device's Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) including the verified boot state, operating system variant and operating system version. The initial verification has some security provided by the Google root certificate. The verification is much more meaningful after the initial pairing as the app primarily relies on Trust On First Use via pinning. It also verifies the identity of the device after the initial verification.\r\n\r\nUsage instructions:\r\n\r\nThe device being verified (Auditee) must be one of the supported devices. Android developer previews aren't supported since the hardware verified version is set to a placeholder value. The device performing verification (Auditor) just needs to be any Android 7.0+ compatible device with a camera.\r\n\r\n1. press Auditor on the device that will be verifying the Auditee\r\n2. press Auditee on the device that's going to be verified\r\n3. point the camera of the Auditee at the QR code on the Auditor to read the challenge\r\n4. tap the QR code on the Auditor to advance ahead (if you do this too early, you can press back)\r\n5. point the camera of the Auditor at the QR code on the Auditee to read the attestation\r\n6. view verification of the attestation results\r\n\r\nAn Auditor can verify any number of different Auditee devices. It shows a fingerprint and the first / last verification time in successful paired attestation results. An Auditee can be verified by any number of Auditors but there will be a different fingerprint for each unique pairing rather than the same fingerprint shown on each Auditor for the same Auditee.\r\n\r\nTo set up regularly scheduled remote verification via the remote attestation service:\r\n\r\n1. create an account on https://attestation.app/ from a separate device\r\n2. press the menu button in the app\r\n3. press the 'Enable remote verification' action in the menu\r\n4. scan the account QR code displayed on https://attestation.app/\r\n5. configure an alert email address to receive alerts if the device fails to provide valid attestations in time\r\n6. refresh https://attestation.app/ to view the initial attestation result"

The apk uploaded to the Play Store is the same as the one here.\r\n\r\n[Changes since the 0.7-beta release](https://github.com/copperhead/Attestation/compare/0.7-beta...0.8-beta).\r\n\r\nThe Copperhead Pixel 2 Auditor uses hardware security features on the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL to validate the integrity of the operating system from another Android device. It will verify that the Pixel 2 (XL) is running either the standard Google Android operating system or CopperheadOS with the bootloader locked and that no tampering with the operating system has occurred. It will also detect downgrades to a previous version.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be bypassed by modifying or tampering with the operating system (OS) because it receives signed device information from the device's Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) including the verified boot state, operating system variant and operating system version. The initial verification has some security provided by the Pixel 2 intermediate and Google root certificates.  The verification is much more meaningful after the initial pairing as the app primarily relies on Trust On First Use via pinning.\r\n\r\nUsage instructions:\r\n\r\nThe device being verified (Auditee) must be a Pixel 2 or Pixel 2 XL. The device performing verification (Auditor) just needs to be any Android 7.0+ compatible device with a camera.\r\n\r\n1. press Auditor on the device that will be verifying the Auditee\r\n2. press Auditee on the Pixel 2 or Pixel 2 XL that's going to be verified\r\n3. point the camera of the Auditee at the QR code on the Auditor to read the challenge\r\n4. tap the QR code on the Auditor to advance ahead (if you do this too early, you can press back)\r\n5. point the camera of the Auditor at the QR code on the Auditee to read the attestation\r\n6. view verification of the attestation results\r\n\r\nAn Auditor can verify any number of different Auditee devices. It shows a fingerprint and the first / last verification time in successful paired attestation results. An Auditee can be verified by any number of Auditors but there will be a different fingerprint for each unique pairing rather than the same fingerprint shown on each Auditor for the same Auditee."

The device performing verification (Auditor) just needs to be an Android device meeting the minSdkVersion requirement (currently 25).\r\n\r\nThe Auditee will fail verification if it isn't running the stock OS or official releases of CopperheadOS with the bootloader locked and no modifications to the OS. It relies on the bootloader and Trusted Execution Environment to provide a signed result of the verified boot state so the OS can't simply provide fake results.\r\n\r\nThe verification becomes much better after the initial pairing between the Auditee and Auditor. The Auditor pins the certificate chain for the attestation results rather than relying on the Pixel 2 (XL) intermediate + Google root and also verifies the attestation message from the Auditee with the public key from the initial key pair that was attested to be hardware-backed.\r\n\r\nUsage instructions:\r\n\r\n1) press Auditor on the device that will be verifying the Auditee\r\n2) press Auditee on the Pixel 2 or Pixel 2 XL that's going to be verified\r\n3) point the camera of the Auditee at the QR code on the Auditor to read the challenge\r\n4) tap the QR code on the Auditor to advance ahead (if you do this too early, you can press back)\r\n5) point the camera of the Auditor at the QR code on the Auditee to read the attestation\r\n6) view verification of the attestation results\r\n\r\nIt currently uses the zxing barcode scanning library, which uses the external zxing app for scanning. This will be switched to bundling the zxing code both to avoid an external app and to allow more customization.\r\n\r\nAn Auditor can verify any number of different Auditee devices. It shows a fingerprint and the first / last verification time in successful paired attestation results. On the other hand, the Auditee can only pair with a single Auditor and the failure case where pairing was interrupted is a bit annoying. This is an issue because the key attestation API doesn't provide an API for generating fresh attestation results. We'll try to improve the usability in the future but to some extent we're constrained so there will be some kind of (less annoying) usability compromise to work around the lack of an API to get fresh attestation results for an existing key instead of a new key:\r\n\r\n> The first time the Auditee generates attestation results, it generates a persistent key and treats itself as paired. If you don't scan the initial attestation results from the Auditor, the Auditee won't know that pairing didn't happen and you'll need to clear the app data on the Auditee either via Settings -> Apps -> Attestation -> Storage -> Clear data or by uninstalling and reinstalling it. Similarly, the same thing needs to be done on the Auditee if you want to switch to a new Auditor. Clearing the data on the Auditor makes it a new Auditor."
