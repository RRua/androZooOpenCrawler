Open app and then select one of the three brightness levels. Two taps to change to another pre-set brightness levels. This is exactly what I need. I have one for dark room, one for indoors and one for outdoors. One thing that I would have liked to have is a widget that cycles to the next brightness level. That way I only need one or two taps to select the brightness level I want instead of always two taps. This is the reason I did not give it 5 stars.', "Can't switch profiles (hidden) when auto is on :( Why not let me tap them? Bug: Auto often doesn't react when pressed (hard when screen is dark)!", "What's up with the icon? It is horrible (how do ppl come up with such bad stuff? Amazing-. Last one was rather ok.", 'Good because you can set brightness levels from 0-100 by press+ hold. Naff home icon though and could use a widget home screen slider.', "I've been using another app with buttons for brightness but it always bugged me that I couldn't create a custom brightness level. This allows you to create buttons for exactly the brightness you want. Bravo!", "Sorry, but minimum brightness doesn't work on my droid x. As soon as you exit to home screen brightness level jumps back up to phone's minimum level", "Does not retain low brightness when leaving settings screen. Useless. Rooted Device - so that can't be the issue.", 'Why do people buy phones they can\'t figure out how to use? See that big "Add" button? Use it! App works great, best brightness app but yeah icon sux.', '1.  Would love an option to control screen brightness with volume control automatically if brightness is low.  I Struggle in bright sunlight some mornings to reset my brightness because I forget to do so when leaving home for the job.  I typically turn brightness all the way down at night.', 'Just like curvefish which has a mind of its own. Brightness adjusts way too far up on its own on incoming calls. Booo  Infuse', 'Some lame ui decisions. But only one that has auto level. Update. Others have auto level and better ui.', "You set up brightness profiles to your liking and switch between them at will. There's not much more to it than that (well, there's auto brightness too as an option, but I don't feel my Moto X's ambient light sensor is all that terrific). The menu is shrewdly displayed in high-contrast white-on-black to help you if you take the phone from a dark setting out into daylight and need to adjust manually. Now all it needs is a suitable (and high-contrast) icon you can find in sunlight.", "Great app! Don't really care what the icon looks like. One of my biggest gripes with my Droid X was that it wasn't bright enough out in the sunlight.", "I keep my brightness turned way down indoors. When I go outside and can't see the screen, this widget is the fastest way to get the job done.   Wish it had a better icon though.", "Exactly what I needed. Let's fix The ugly icon already. EVO", '6 stars if you design widget that displays current setting or least change icon; currently fugly. Otherwise perfect app. A+', 'The brightness is very customizable and once set up to your preferences its easy to access - just 2 taps really! Please create a better icon to make it look more professional and easy on the home screen (that blue looks cheap)', 'Just what I needed. Nice to be able to use custom profiles to switch between settings instead of using predefined ones. Icon is very unappealing.', 'Great app. It **was** the only app on my home screen, unfortunately the new icon may cause me to change that fact. Please provide optional icon.', 'One of my only droid x complaints was lack of this app. Very nice.', 'Works well on the KF with Go Launcher EX.  I have used this on the HTC Incredible and then the Mot D2G for a long time to conserveon battery usage.  Highly recommend.  Auto brightness does not work on the KF, but that is a specific issue with the KF and not this app.', 'This is exactly what I was looking for...if on your homescreen, it takes two selections! Also, not a widget that might slow down your phone!', 'Just perfect. Simple, light-weight, and is the only brightness app that does what I want. Ugly icon. -Evo.', 'Evo 2.2 Froyo.Works perfect. Maybe could make a better way of viewing a "0" level setting in full sun. Ex: make colors black/white or make fonts BIG.', 'Seems to be the only widget that takes level down to 0%, as opposed to others that get stuck after AutoBrightness. Not keen on icon though. Desire 2.2', "One thing I love is the simplicity of this app. It's straight forward, not bloated, and does just what you need it to. Much thanks to the dev. Peace.", "If your device doesn't support auto brightness, this app is a must have. The icon could use some improvement.", 'Such a well done and easy to use app. My favorite features are the ability to save different brightness defaults and using the volume toggle.. Genius! Thank you for your hard work!', "It's cool, I think the developer doesn't don't want bring back the old icon, maybe just out of protest because everyone asks for this lol", 'Why I can\'t select profiles while "Auto" is marked? My phone supports different brightness levels with Auto at the same time! Make a better HD quality icon too...', 'Works. Ugly icon. Would like % displayed in icon. Droid Incredible', 'App is very useful, but the new icon is ugly. The old icon better represented brightness control.', 'Great one step way to change brightness. I keep this on my Evo main page to quickly adjust. Very convenient. No problems at all.', "Best I've seen. Fully customizable yet straightforward and simple. One click to open, one click to choose setting, and it auto closes. Voila, perfect.", 'Works great on Jellybean! This is the best one.  Easy, slick and customisable.  2013!  Why use anything else!', 'Great app but definitely needs a new icon! Smaller fonts would work too. Keep up the good work!', 'Finally what I was looking for. Abt the only thing missing is ability to reorder custom buttons. Thanks Craig!', '1 mistake and u might shoot ur self.dnt usw this app', 'By far the BEST brightness app, get it. Needs a real simple but pro looking icon. Someone please make one. Press n hold profiles to edit or del.', "Best I've seen.
