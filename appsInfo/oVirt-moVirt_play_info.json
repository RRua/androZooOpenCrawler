{'title': 'moVirt', 'description': 'moVirt is an Android client for oVirt/RHEV which aims not to duplicate the features of the existing web clients but to be a useful companion application of them. It contains three main features: (1) monitoring of VM health like memory/cpu utilization, status and events, (2) integration with SPICE and VNC and (3) bridging the physical world of servers with virtual world of oVirt using the techniques of augmented reality which can scan datamatrix codes located physically on servers completing the camera view by additional data like host status, resource utilization and VMs running on it.', 'descriptionHTML': 'moVirt is an Android client for oVirt/RHEV which aims not to duplicate the features of the existing web clients but to be a useful companion application of them.
