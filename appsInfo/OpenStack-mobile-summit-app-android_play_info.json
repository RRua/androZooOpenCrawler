The design is nice, and clearly a lot of thought went into it.', 'Fine', "UPDATE 2: Pressing back from the menus (notifications, speakers etc.) *still* closes the app. Not sure dev is testing this themselves, as they keep partially fixing; hitting back from settings doesn't close app, but all other pages does. Requires an eventbrite order number to customise a calendar, which seems bizarre. Still no way to add your summit to your calendar; you have to add each event individually.", 'Every time I raise the app, the listing returns to initial default state, rather that retaining last state. "Filter" function does not full have full-text search or tags. A function to group "my" sessions by time block to facilitate selection and jockeying would be nice.', "Update: II was finally able to log in after perhaps 15 attempts, and varying issues encountered following the same steps.  There were very long delays once submitting credentials, and consent to access to contacts, etc.    That said, the app works once logged in, but it leaves much to be desired.  When returning to the app it forgets your place, i.e., starts from Sunday ever time.  I can't figure out how I might export this calendar to my own, like my google or Outlook calendar.    A nice feature might be to see all sessions that are at the same time as a group that slides left and right, allowing selection of the one you want in that time slot, rather than having to scroll up and down a long, long list of sessions.    Previously:  This application is just terrible for me.  I can't log in at all, and I get varying errors when I try.  I have tried perhaps 10 times, uninstalled and re-installed, tried again, and so forth.  Useless.", "At least it opened, unlike mitaka.

Simple things like scrolling to the beginning of the day after looking at a session details or the fact that old sessions are not hidden/inactive make usage frustrating.', 'Does exactly what it needs to do and nothing more. Simple. Elegant.', "The app always reset it's state, making it annoying to scroll through so many sessions when looking for the next. MUST have a schedule builder for custom track and schedule.
