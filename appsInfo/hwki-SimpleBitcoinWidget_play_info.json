But two issues. 1). When you have several of these widgets for different currencies, only one (bitcoin) refreshes at a specified interval and only one (again bitcoin) can be manually refreshed. The other currencies seem to refresh at half an hour interval and also can\'t be manually refreshed. 2).

I've been looking for an app such as this for a long time. It is super useful to me. However in order to make the app flawless, in my opinion, an alarm should be added, and also the ability to change size of widget to 1x1. Perhaps another couple themes wouldn't hurt.
