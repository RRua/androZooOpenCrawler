This is one of those apps. It simply displays a slowly spinning STL file and allows you to rotate the image manually. The ability to see a skeleton view and texture an STL image is a nice feature. The stereoscopic viewing features are a nice touch. It gives me a reason to dig out my old Google cardboard VR glasses.
