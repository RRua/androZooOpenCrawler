myself coming back to this app as a reference continually and find it helps me with all kinds of situations, every time I catch myself needing more information about accounts I'm working on I find myself coming back to this app, I think it's on of the most important app I have.", 'Great app, but I cannot view .PDF documents. It is just showing me some symbols instead.', 'Excellent !!! it would be nice though to have a section for GitLab as well many projects are moving there.', 'Please support viewing images inside the app and not in a Web browser. It would be nice.', 'All I needed to use this app for was to view and manage issues and this app handles this flawlessly!', 'Good like everything is normal interface', "You can't view as a visitor? A lot of devs pot their work here for download", 'Helpful & great apps!!', 'I like the app, but it keeps logging me out, it would be nice to have the app remember my session. It often gives some java exception when trying to login. So I have to do it multiple times.', "Best Android Github client I've found! It's unfortunate that you are logged out after a while and have to log back in. If you use autofill, it makes it really quick though.", 'A perfect app. But it doesn\'t natively support the Two Factor Authentication, requiring you to use default browser to login. So hoping it can just pop up a dialog where you enter your one-time code instead of showing "Unauthorized".', 'nearly perfect, the vertical spacing on the issue title and the next line is clashing and looks a bit ugly, would love to see this fixed.  also the edit button overlaps the \'XX hours ago" text in the issue view.', "Peefect! The only thing I would change is there no way to create new repositories. But other than that it's a beautiful app that I-d recommend it to anyone! Thank you developers! Edit: After looking at other GitHub apps I realized none of them seem to allow repo creation, which is absolutely STUPID, but is most likely Git or GitHub's fault due to design it implementation flaw (foolish developers lol) and certainly not OpenHub's fault, so I apologize for the 4 star rating. Changing to 5 now. :)", "This looks and feels like a super buggy clone of OctoDroid with many features missing, like ability to see pull requests. It also matches OD bug for bug in some strange cases,so I'm not certain why this even exists.", 'Definitely some issues with login. Not sure if the oauth login message at the bottom is supposed to be a link, but despite being logged in from the browser, username/email and password will not login.', "The app makes it very easy to access your settings and repositories and the news about it. But t one down side is that you can't edit the files of the repository or delete it. It would be a much better app if it had those freatures.", "Can't sign up!!!!!!! Keep getting an error message.. Just won't let me sign up.. Please fix.. Been like this for months now!!! I will review my rating accordingly.. Your lucky you got 3*", 'I will give you 5 stars if you can fix login problem. Everytime i use this app, i keep relogin (which is incovenient because oAuth). I hope you can add an option about this. Overal this is best mobile github app', 'Good app, could do improvements with 2FA sign ins and a better layout.', 'One feature I would like to see is to open a github link in app. Ether from browser via deep link or or a button with "enter github url". This would be great way to get around GH\'s ugly mobile browser interface. Other than that it\'s really neat (:', 'Very nice app, but there seems to be no way to view pull requests, whether it be my own repos or others.', 'Nice smooth interface. Similar enough to github to be an easy learn but different enough to take advantage of the phone interface.', "Nice and simple! I love the experience ❤️ It'd be even better if I can see my contribution graph on the info page in profile Good experience overall 👍👌", 'The app is good but some functionalities are limited, you have to improve that thing', "works great, but it keeps loving me out, and for some reason you can't use it when logged out.", "Great but doesn't display submodules or link to the correctly.", "Beautiful user interface and works really great. If you add notification support it'll be perfect!", 'Check issues #7 and #12 on the GitHub-repo of this app. This is obviously a fork of OctoDroid and FastHub with copyright-issues. Uninstall.', 'Thank you. No ads and works better than expected. This is a very unselfish gift. Very much appreciated.', 'I depend on this app for source for my programming languages that may be needed. It is a concise, thorough repository that gives the opportunity to share sourcecode, and use sourcecode of others. If you currently use sourceforge, you will like Openhub for Github.', "Pretty good overall, but code viewing is mediocre and there's no support for issues, milestones and projects.", 'Great app for managing my GitHub account. No crashes so far compared to other clients.', "Please add cache refreshing feature,I need to go to phone settings and clear cache every time I change my profile or someone's profile is changed.", 'looks great, runs smoothly but... why can we not edit files? not much use for me otherwise..', 'Does not save login information. Tired of constantly logging in.', "Best github android client available and it's really good! the only important option missing is a place to see pull requests", "The app forces you to login in order to use it and it doesn't keep you logged in.", 'I have nine browsers installed. The app still throws "no browser clients installed" when trying to open a Github link with it.', 'This is super cool. I love the app so much.
