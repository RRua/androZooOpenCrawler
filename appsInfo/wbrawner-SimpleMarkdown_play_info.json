Great for editing text files in Google Drive. One little gripe, the new line of text is somewhat overly close to the bottom bar - parts of the text that extend below the line, like commas, y, j and g are hidden by the bar. Otherwise, still very functional.', "Swiping BODY OF TEXT switches between editor mode & preview mode, like the best Markdown editors do. However, Swiping the LEFT/RIGHT BORDERS TO CENTER does not do anything. These two are completely unused, unlike other good editors. Also unused: top toolbar + bottom toolbar. Also can have 3dot ... and hamburger menus (3lines) options in top/bottom toolbars when they're added finally.", 'Good potential Works well but lacks equation, tables, check boxes etc which do not display correctly in preview. Could not directly upload to OneDrive.', 'I miss the support for latex equations. For the rest is seems great, good job.', "This app can edit Markdown files stored anywhere. Other apps limit themselves to only use them either internally or within a specific directory. Even on my old Pixel XL, it still can't overwrite files. Maybe because when the theme changes, it can empty the file if it's not saved.", "I like the interface but there are issues I've seen: - there's a lag when typing, often missing keypresses - about 1 in 4 saves to a nextcloud account deleted the file contents - this may be an issue with nextcloud - can't scroll to the bottom of a file once it's reached about 50 lines", 'Love the look and feel and the easy preview mode. The only problems I\'ve encountered so far is that when I chose it to handle a file editing intent from another app (PocketGit in this case), it doesn\'t have to that file, but instead an "autosave.md", and I\'m limited to saving the file to downloads or drive (neither of which is what I need)', "With all due respect to Goldilocks, this app is just right. Not too little, not too much. It does exactly what I want and it does it well. There are a couple issues, but it's opensource, so maybe I need to have a look at them and see what I can do.", "I agree with Joshua Yeow. And also little point from me: it'd be nice to have zooming capabilities. Looking forward for new release!", "it's so simple with clean interface. but the preview style is ugly. it's a good idea to add style in settings or set a beautiful style by default.", 'Very good editor, nice preview, able to scroll long strings. If you add a dark theme I will mark with 5 stars.', 'Great, clean and simple. 5 stars of it would have syntax highlighting like sublime text or attom, where # is orange and something between **astrix** will be bold in editor vieuw.', 'Finally a nice free simple markdown app without ads or crippled feature. Any chance that a landscape preview only feature will be added?', 'This is my favorite markdown editor.
