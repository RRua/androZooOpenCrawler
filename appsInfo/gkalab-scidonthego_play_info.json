Please resolve this bug. But I can't download from twice as well.", "Can't search dates if there is only a year in the pgn file (1956.??.?? Doesn't work for example. The latest update says it updated to SF 11 but it did not and the engine isn't in the folder. Understand now. Maybe some better instructions in the help?", 'Only one thing missing in this app..there is no "arrow line" to show possible move in analysis mode. Everyone cant read it by notations only. Pls develop it.', 'Display Arrows for Variations And Add Number of Variation', "I would like autoplay to be even faster, let us say, 0,5s per move. 1s seems too slow, and I never use it although I like this feature. Also the font of the players' names is too big, gigantic, they have not enough space on the screen. Please, make the font much smaller on order for the White and the Black's names be properly displayed on the screen of a smartphone.", 'Scid on the go is really a great app, especially after I managed to convert (using scidb on linux) my chessbase databases to the scid format si4. ;) But I cannot success in finding how to search an opened database according to a given pawn structure, up to color switching or not. The best available is "search current board" and then the closest to what Iook is "same material, all pawns on same squares" but is not the criterion I am looking for.', 'Perfect ever app and a pgn tool for android platform, i highly recommend it to all chess lovers. If three options are more added, will be a brilliant app, (example) 1.Seperate autoplay button 2. An engine evaluiton bar, 3. And an arrow for analyzing best move... Thanks and regards', "I love this app, but in order to give it a 5 star i would like this app to go to the next variation automatically when I am in study mode practicing an opening that I've downloaded in pgn format. Also many time when I am review mode it keeps jumping to study mode by itself. If these to things would change in the next update i will give it a 5 star.", 'I wanted to use this to access my opening repertoire on mobile.

Also option in setting to show arrow on display for engine move when analysing would be nice.', "It's really clunky when it comes to checking variations/candidate moves. It would be so much better if review and analysis modes where merged; and the engine on/off put on a toggle on the top line.  It has a long way to go to get close to the PC version; ok for a free app, but the dev has done better work before.", 'It\'s the greatest app for chess lovers.I love it so much.

Kindly let me know if there is a way out to do this.', "Excellent app. There is a slight possibility for improvements and this will undoubtly be the best app on any platform. 1. Simple touch controls on the board for nevigation instead of buttons would have been better. Would be much useful for left handed people too. 2. While user is Guessing the move, in case of wrong move correct move and the best move from engines perspective would make it extremely useful. Also, the score of user's actual move compared to engine and the grandmaster would be awesome.  Still the app stands second to none even if compared to paid apps.", 'Non user friendly interface too many questions are raised when you try to use this app .', 'Only wish study mode would also choose variations, not only mainline.
