Additionally there are the following versions of counting points:\r\n- None: No points are counted.\r\n- Standard: The Player starts with zero points, moves give different points.\r\n- Vegas: The Player starts at -52 points and tries to get more than zero points, while the deck can only be passed through one time.\r\n\r\nThe Player can generate an automatic move by clicking the Hint-Button or automatically move all possible cards to the foundation by shaking the device (if it is activated in the Settings).\r\nAddtionally he can undo and redo moves.
