The alarm sound is really great..good thinking on that..an option to turn on and off vibration or sound maybe cool..an option for more than one alarm would be great but  would need different sounds..and how about an option for a prewarning sound that starts like 15 seconds before the alarm,  i think a sizzle sound that gets louder would be the bomb..', 'Great simple app, its best feature is being able to view and control on the lock screen.
