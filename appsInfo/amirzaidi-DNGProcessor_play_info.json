Paired with OpenCamera I can snap just RAW files and allow DNG Processor to output much more detailed images than the base OnePlus camera. No real issues with speed, but OnePlus's aggressive background suppression means I have to manually trigger it sometimes. A Tasker plug in might be a nice feature to trigger it after closing the camera. Much better alternative than trying to figure out all the half working Gcam ports. EDIT: Whitelisted!", "Incredible app that I never thought could exist. It reliably improves the output of my OnePlus 5T's camera, and without the need of root. I've also seen it in action in a Huawei P20 Lite and the quality, specially in dim conditions, is very noticeable. Definitely something worth trying if your device supports taking pictures in RAW.", "Wow this does the job it describes and does it well. i have LOS running on my Galaxy S7 edge and which doesn't have the best camera quality, but this works wonders with RAWs from OpenCamera. My only problem is that OpenCamera's preview stutters pretty bad when this app is processing RAWs, but reading the app description it is understandable I suppose.", "Does a pretty good job and the colors are good too. I've been using a LG G5 with Open Camera to take the pictures. Noise is still a tad grainy on high ISO setting compared to stock. Hopefully we can see some settings to configure noise reduction.", 'Hey developers. i have google pixel 2 with me.and this app is not working with this device.i also tried it manually but its not working yet.plz make a fix on it i need this so crazyly ðŸ˜”', "Very good! It's no substitute for manual tuning, of course, but it quickly produces good quality jpgs.", "ay man this some crazy stuff right here, I usually give some in-depth reviews but all I can say for this is that it's doing something incredible with raw images... 10/10 must have for advanced users.", "the app just doesn't work for DNG files produced by the V30. All the photos come out as blank white with randomer black dots. unfortunate.", "No idea how it works but it's great, nice accurate colours and improved detail from the u ultra camera (no good gcam ports). Can't reccomend enough", 'Works well but, there is more noise in photos than the camera-processed photos .', 'Genius idea for us without a Gcam Port.Waiting for the next updates :D', "Can you add a camera icon to open camera on the app so I don't have to have the app continously running in the background?
