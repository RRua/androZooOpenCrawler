I was so frustrated when the soft keys stopped working. Now I have peace of mind knowing that I don't have to buy another phone😄😄😄 thanks for the great app", 'does exactly what its called. fantastic bit of software that adds software keys to your device. very simple to setup and just works.', 'This works great. Combine with an app to hide soft keys and you get more screen real estate. The only bad thing is no visual feedback when pressing the keys.', 'Works great! One suggestion: add a toggle to leave the activation area colours turned on all the time - - would make it easier during setup and testing with different apps. Edit: Another request: Ability to adjust the spacing between the buttons, ability to move the button group to the left or right side of the screen. That would make them more thumb-friendly on tablets.', "Excellent app for a device with broken softkeys. May I suggest a countdown timer which starts counting after last press (resets with every press on the bar). Now the bar disappears after set seconds and it often happens just when I'm about to press one of the keys. So that it would stay visible as long as I keep pressing plus set seconds. Alternatively the bar could be thinner so that I can keep it on permanently. Anyhow, a lifesaver as it is. Thanks!", 'OK but Some bugs. *It interferes with the keyboard making lower keys (space bar, return, comma etc unresponsive). *Sometimes the soft keys dont dissappear when programmed, they hang on screen requiring use of device keys to remove *No way of disabling. ie no on or off switch. You have to uninstall completely if you just want to switch off for a while.', 'Horrible to use, my hardware based buttons stopped working and this didnt help at all, using a different app now.', 'A great and a very helpfull app but i have a big querry about its permission s,I am using it on Nokia 6 (2017)and this app popped up a message while accesibility permission that enabling it would disable "Lock screen data encryption" or something,what is it and can that bother my device in any sense...?please help.', "Not good app. Cannot be resized and it's not for Android phones. On my phone, in landscape, the gesture area is bottom and the navigation bar is bottom. Uninstalled", "Works very well! the only inconvenient I found is that the bar doesn't hide automatically until you push something outside the bar. In my opinion, the timeout should start immediatelly after sliding it up and removing your finger, not after unfocusing it.", 'I was frustrated that my One Plus navigation buttons disappeared after an upgrade. This made browser/phone use incredibly annoying. I am grateful I found this app to restore some sensible UI to my phone!', "Its awesome it's just if I leave my phone open too long it shuts down the app Zzz's", 'Does not work with Android 10, it seems.', 'Installed this today and so far its working incredibly! This has saved me from getting a new phone since its only the bottom buttons are broken on mine, thank you so much!', 'Wow, this app has literally saved me from a world of headache and frustratrion, as the crack on my screen has disabled all three soft keys. thank you!', 'Just installed a few hours ago Working great so far May update after a few days Atleast its doing what i was looking for', "This is amazing app, very helpful to me as my phone's soft keys are not visible at night. Thanks developer.", 'It works, i tried similar 2 to 3 apps which were failed. finally got the perfect app.', 'I was planning to buy a new phone when virtual buttons were broken(letv 1s). Salute to this idea and its execution. Thanks virtual softkey team.', 'Thanks a lot works great it helped me because my both navigation button were not working.👌👍', 'Load of rubbish! Yes it creates virtual keys but you cannot swipe them down out of sight as told! Only way to do this is to uninstall!', 'back botton is not working but after *I knew* page there is no backspace erow on page it creates little bit problem', 'I like because my gesture button is not work. So I search on Google and I will have finally find this app and I will be used this app. I love you virtual SoftKeys app.......', 'Its convenient since my buttons dont work but my screen turns on sometimes. Is there a fix to this?', 'Amazing. This app saved me from having to get a whole new phone, very grateful', 'works awesomly with my device i have been using virtual soft keys since june 2017 and not a single problem thanks for giving me such great soft keys ☺☺', 'If you could increase the touch height by a little more it would be helpful', 'It works well. No doubt. But I just wonder does it acts like a keylogger? Which sends everything to owner', 'It switch offs atomatically after sometime when we are not using our mobile....', 'great but missing 3-dashes action menu :(', "A life saver! My navigation keys stopped working suddenly for some reason, and I was dreading having to get a new phone or paying to get this one repaired .

It properly works Thank u team DAXIA', 'it is auto off when screen is off then request allow to start then request off.', 'the back button is not working not helpful at all', "Enabled draw over other apps but it doesn't recognize the setting.", 'it switch off automatically after a minute especially if u are not using it', "It's not working worst app please remove from the store.", 'Long press not working', 'good. wish u cd make the bar slimmer'], 'appId': 'tw.com.daxia.virtualsoftkeys', 'url': 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tw.com.daxia.virtualsoftkeys&hl=en&gl=us'}
