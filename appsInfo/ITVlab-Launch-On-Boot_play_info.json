Perfect unfussy well written app. Kudos and thank you.', 'Needs a timed feature and reboot option.

It works when I restart but not if I just put the device to sleep and then wake it back up, which in kinda the whole point since the shield tv only goes to sleep and does not "turn off," so this just didn\'t work for me. Not sure if I needed to set it up differently.  It does wake from the screensaver to the selected app but not from the shields "sleep" mode. The app does exactly what it says it does, it just doesn\'t work for my application with the Nvidia Shield TV. If you\'re using a shield and you put it into sleep mode all the time, this probably won\'t fit your need.', 'Worked on X96mini android box , Not work on MI BOX Chinese OS (MDZ-16-AA)', 'Good app. It does what I needed very simply and, for the most part, works.', 'hdmi launcing is not in launch onboot..i want to start up my cable tv using \nhdmi only..', 'This app makes my life so much better', 'Works perfectly!', 'simply awesome', 'Tried this on a Shield TV.
