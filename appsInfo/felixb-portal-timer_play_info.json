Thanks so much!', 'it does.  There are 3 timers. Simple but effective.', 'Works perfectly and is very convenient', 'Simple, useful, open source', 'Simple and effective!', None, 'I love this app, and it has saved me from missing important hacks.  However, I would like to suggest a seemingly simple feature enhancement.  Time correction for mods:  It would be excellent, if i could define a portal profile for each of the four slots.  for example, if a portal has a headsink, i can hack it every 4 minutes, in stead of 5.  if a portal has a multihack, might want to revisit it when the 4 hour window is up.  Could that be done?  allow the user to build profiles for portals they care about, and then apply a profile to one of the four timers?', 'Changing my review because this app mostly doesn\'t work.  When I\'m running portal timer, I would expect the timer to be of the highest priority since I\'ll only be running it when I really need it - during Ingress. However, it frequently gets killed by the system when the device is low on resources. Furthermore, it randomly stops at certain intervals - sometimes 20 minutes into a 4 hour timer, sometimes 2 or 3 minutes into a 5 minute countdown, it simply stops and never rings. The app it still there in the notifications panel, but the timer is paused. Clicking the stuck timer wakes it up as if it remembers "Oh, right, I\'m done!" and then it instantly skips however much it fell asleep for and notifies of an expired timer, if the duration was long enough. As such, this app is only rarely useful, when it work.  Will test on CM once I install it, it could be the stock 4.1.2 is choking up resources on my S3 so bad not even a timer can properly run, and will alter the review again if everything is as it should be.', 'Best portal timer app out, love the fact I can access it from the drop down menu!', 'Love the changes. One more nice option would be different sounds for each timer.', 'Thanks a ton!', 'Make sure to customize one to be 4hrs!', 'Simple, clean and effective that needs only a couple features to make it awesome. An option for audible alerts. Plus, it could use some kind of counter. Amazingly, I have to think twice sometimes on how many times I have hacked a portal.', "Very clean and easy to use app. I would appreciate seeing a hack counter that I could use when hacking farms, have trouble remembering how many times I've walked around the park.", 'My strategy is to loop around a few portals, and so each counter triggers a different loop.  The only thing that would be a benefit would be a 4 hr countdown so I could know when to come back to that loop', 'Very helpful and I like that it shows in the task bar so I can get to it easily.  It would be nice to add a couple of 4 hour timers to the app.', 'Love the implementation of this timer. You can set the timers straight from the notification bar without having to open the app again like the other portal timer apps. Also no ads!', 'Please add the ability to increase the number of portals. I can hack a 5 portal cluster in 5 minutes. Thanks.', 'Great app, but an exit button and the possibility to have 4 or 5 timers (maybe with different colors) would make it perfect', 'Not about adding LatLong coordintions to the pressed timer, and when the time is up, it brings up Google Map and show the location?', 'No exit option? It just keeps running in the tool bar, how can I exit the app when unnecessary?', 'If you are going to make an app like this it should at least have multiple options like the 5mins all mine have 35min timers and ability to have more timers running', 'ещё бы звук уведомления можно было бы менять...', "Pretty good however I'd love to see it integrate GPS bookmarking somehow.", 'Давно искала такое приложение.', 'The best thing about this app is how it stays out of the way unless you actually want to interact with it.

The way this timer works, the UI for it, is perfect for Ingress. However, it doesn't account for heatsinks on a particular node which makes the app less than optimal for farming.  I ended up using a kitchen timer app instead of this one.", "App doesn't work on Miui 7. Only white square on the status bar", 'Отлично ! Именно то, что я и искал, 3 таймера, все они видны в баре и не сворачивают игру, тап по уведомлению в баре открывает всплывающее окно, которое тоже не вырубает сканер ингресса.
