It would be easier for users if some setting options can be given as toggle buttons on home screen such as compass rotation. A great utility.', "Developer of the app is very good at what he is doing. And especially a person who is listening user's on what could be done better.", 'Excellent maps function', 'Terrific test tool for inspecting the gps accuracy. Clean stable interface, and it shows the whether the “dual-frequency” GNSS feature is functioning. Additionally the "accuracy" test allows one to compare the device\'s gps reading with one\'s actual physical position on an arial photo. Plus it has no ads !', "overall v.good. many issues on an aging galaxy s4 lollipop such as gps time is 20 years and 1 hour off (search: gps rollover bug 19th april 2019) and also niggly UI inconsistencies such as this same app on an s8 on android 9 has different column headers. still... gets a fix and injecting and resetting xtra data can be handy. map view is nice when you don't want the bloat of google maps. free and no ads. 5 stars on newer devices, 1 star on old ones", "fast, noninvasive, ad-free app. unlike many of the other GPS test apps, this doesn't require unnecessary access to phone data, camera etc, it just needs location. app is quick to locate satellites and provides good info. interface is basic, but is clear and easy to understand. and no ads!! its like it was built by people who just care about making a good tool. good app!!", 'GREAT!! Very good app!! Found the link on Github. Helped me finally figure out why I got no TTFF reported with several GPS apps I use. All worked on older phones/tablets  but not on Android 7.0. TTFF first didn\'t show up in this one too till I turned off the "use GNSS APIs" in the provided settings options. Then TTFF showed up correctly when letting it use the legacy GPSStatus.Listener. Searching on internet didn\'t give me a hit on a bug in these APIs but as it seems there is? I\'ve turned GNSS usage back on again, being more accurate as I understood. Anyway, thnx dev for this great app. Love the map future too BTW :)', "Does what it says on the tin. Not all carrier frequencies for the E5 bands are properly labelled, likely due to dev being in the US where Gallileo isn't operating yet, but just keep in mind anything much closer to 1600MHz than to 1100MHz is an E5/L5 or similar frequency band (so on the new, dual frequency GNSS bands) and you'll be set.", 'Failed to collect latlng even when other apps are showing location accurately.', 'This cannot be anything but 5 star. Great satelite, freq, ss info, a lot of derails on the fix and no ads. Great thanks to the developer.', "Does it calibrate the GPS? There isn't a option for it when others provide that. Awsome application. I'm very impressed with everything so far and considering it's free and without adds! Amazing!", 'would be a 5 for me if it showed the list of satelites grouped by types like GPS,Glonass,Beidou. other than that, one of the best for app so far I have seen! grat Update: by default the short is by constellation, that is sorting, not grouping', 'very good app,but i have a few questions why there is two altitudes? first one is in (-)tive always,what it is??.. second one is MSL altitude this one is correct..', 'Excelent. In English and many other languages ! The language depends on the current phone language.', 'Works great! Does exactly what it says. 100% open source app and great fix to update GPS location / toggle phone to reset the GPS and refix your location.', 'Great app. Simple to use, does the jod well, immediate gps fix with all the info, free, no adds or payed content, even has a datk theme.', 'Best app for this purpose. However, 1 less star because its name is confusing when someone search for it the store shows other apps with similar name.. I suggest renaming the app to "GNSS Tester" it\'ll be unique which makes users find it faster and can recognize it easier.', 'A fair app. Only wished it could give MGRS coordinates.', 'I am impressed. A lot of information and easy to use. Exactly what I needed.', 'First I had another "GPS Test" app (the one with the colorful icon), but that was just a toy. Now this looks interesting.', 'Clear and informative app, very useful as a sanity check when used with Viewranger. Open source too.', 'Helpful app, useful for getting detailed technical info about GPS and diagnosing issues with your device.', 'Excellent app. Really useful. Simple but informative interface.', 'Small, precise, fast, ad-free, works nicely. What else could I need?', 'Nice overview of GPS constellation and phone capabilities. Very handy utility.', 'Hello! Great app! I see Indian SBAS in the list. Does it mean my device only supports Indian SBAS? (I can\'t see any SBAS satellite @ "Sky" view.)', 'only app i found to display gps time and location. perfect for astronomers who need it for telescope alignment.', 'Ad free and works, unlike every other GPS test app out there.', 'no ads, does what it says. :). happy user this side!', 'Excellent !
