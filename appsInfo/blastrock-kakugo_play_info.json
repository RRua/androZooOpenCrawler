other resources. And the comprehensive coverage of types of review (especially handwriting practice) is what really sets this app apart from other options. I'm not studying by JLPT levels (N5, N4, N3, etc.) but it's nice that review items are put into a category for each level. I find this app to be better than other options, paid or otherwise.", "The best app for learning kana. While I think there are better apps for learning kanji, this one is still decent though, it's still unmatched for kana. And it's open source, so if you want to change or add something, you can do it yourself!", "I like it but the kanji/kana drawing mode should automatically show next kanji/kana like other modes. No need to click next button. Kanji study app does it that way too. hopefully it'll be implemented in the future updates. great app so far and i use it as my main way to study kanji. thanks.", 'thanks for this app! love it! super helpful! im mainly using it for kanji review. in kanji we can create sub set of lists i hope we can do that in vocabulary too. thanks and god bless!', 'Speech output is missing, but still it is best app I have seen so far to learn Japanese.', 'I found this app way less stessful than anki. It\'s really great for learning kanji in the "throne room"', 'This is literally one of the best kanji apps on Android. I am astounded it has so few downloads.', 'This app is intelligent, efficient, and free, as in free software.  I love it\xa0!', 'Just came from reddit. You made it in the perfect timing for me, as I am learning kanji right now and need this kind of assistance. Thank You!', 'Great app! Ad free and free!
