This may be going into the next stable release.\r\n\r\n# Known beta issues\r\n\r\n* bus list stops displaying routes when no route appears for a certain route. This will be fixed for beta 3\r\n\r\n# Changes\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes:\r\n- Clearing transit no longer lags\r\n- Pittsburgh should always be the center point of the map. Previously, the app will zoom on Africa (latitude, longitude (0, 0)) on certain edge cases\r\n\r\n## Code Changes\r\n- fix problems with extraneous calls to remove map elements redundantly\r\n- Update all @JakeWharton dependencies (you handsome man...)\r\n\r\n## UI Differences (tweaking)\r\n- route lines (polylines) now thinner\r\n- stops no longer translucent\r\n"

Now, the phone will correctly distinguish these two cases.\n\nThis bug happened because we would check the internet down state on `IOException`. When Port Authority's servers are down, `Retrofit` (the library we use to poll internet requests from Port Authority) will throw a `SocketTimeoutException` if the servers refuse to send a response. We didn't realize that this extended `IOException`, so the app mistakenly would think that the phone's connection is down.\n\nTo fix this, I made sure to add logic where I check to make sure that the error thrown by Retrofit is an `IOException` but not a `SocketTimeoutException`.\n"

All relevant code changes are in Pull Request #279 \n\n## New Features\n- Detour Information now in 3 Dot Menu\n- Application Information to see App Settings in the Android Settings App now in 3 Dot Menu\n- Map now zooms in on you when location permissions are accepted and location tracking is on.\n\n## Bug Fixes\n- Camera state completely fixed -- #223 \n  - no longer zooms to Africa randomly\n  - App now keeps camera state when reopening app\n- No more leaks with vehicle update interval\n- Bus vehicles now will reupdate when reconnected to internet. Previously, they would just freeze when internet was reconnected.\n- Bus vehicles now update when navigation drawer is out. Previously, buses would stop updating when the bus list was open and would only run when bus list was off.\n- App now reacts to Location Permissions correctly. Previously, the app would randomly crash when changing permissions\n\n## Code Enhancements\n\nSee #279 for all code changes between the previous release versions.\n- Map is now in its own Fragment\n- Bus clicks are fully reactive\n- Now using ReactiveNetwork to reactively see new app updates\n\n## Added Android Permissions\n- WIFI State permissions -- App needs to know wifi state if internet disconnected\n  - **android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE**\n  - **android.permission.CHANGE_WIFI_STATE**\n- Network Permission -- App needs to know cell phone network state if internet is disconnected\n  - **android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE**\n- **android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION** -- App needs to know \"inaccurate\" location permission to center the map on you.\n\n# Known Issues\n- #276 -- Polylines (route lines) do not show on the map when the app didn't precache route information and when reconnected. Ideally, when reconnected, the app will download polylines from Port Authority for all selected routes with no current polyline info.\n- There are bugs with route line coordinate parsing where if the polyline coordinates being read are somehow not actual numbers, the app will just crash. This will be fixed with #196.\n- Internet disconnection and reconnection messages will loop when connected to walled-garden wifi. The greatest example of this is connecting to Starbucks' wifi connection and not accepting their terms in the browser. This is actually expected; however, unfortunately, I cannot check for a walled-garden state easily. This will be fixed in a future version.\n"

App will prompt that the vehicle data is being retrieved again\n\n## Miscellaneous\n- add permissions for:\n  - internet connection state\n  - wifi state\n\n# Description\n\nSince the app's beginnings, it had a bug where disconnecting the phone's data connection from the internet then reconnecting the internet will leave the app stagnant where vehicle data would never update unless the app is restarted or the screen is rotated. This update addresses this issue by handling this data and waiting for the vehicle updater to restart when internet is back.\n\nKeep in mind that the added permissions may deter users from using the app. We only use these permissions for the above case so far, and in the future, we will be using this for polylines, too. We can ensure that we are not going to use this for other purposes, and this is reflected in the code.\n\nEverything in [7.0b4](https://github.com/rectangle-dbmi/Realtime-Port-Authority/releases/tag/7.0b4) applies to this release as well as previous betas\n\nTechnical details are here: #277 \n"

This is a huge complete rewrite of the app despite seemingly no new features. I want to squash bugs before this is released in production. In addition, for all issues not known, please complain to me about them (but not in reviews)\n\n## Bug Fixes\n- Camera is completely in all situations. No more centering to Africa.\n- Permissions in Android M should now work as expected in a non-hacky way\n- all network leaks fixed\n\n## Added Features\n- If you completely deny the locations permission, a Snackbar will pop up saying you should allow it to show the map on you.\n- added a menu option to see the app permissions\n\n## Known Issues -- not complain about these following bugs\n- Connection Handoffs kill the reloading of the buses. Must restart app to have the buses re-update if this happens.\n- hamburger menu completely broken. Will be fixed in next release\n\n## Backend Updates\n- Whole map was moved into its own class (fragment) -> more modular code which will pave the way for more and better features\n- bus selection now works reactively with ReactiveX\n  - buses now update instantly on selecting buses\n  - bus unselection now handled reactively\n  - no more chance of network leaks\n\n# What to expect for next release\n- List of buses will be abiding by Material Design standards\n"

    "body": "# Obtaining the Release\n\nPlease download and install the app from our [Google Play Store page](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=rectangledbmi.com.pittsburghrealtimetracker).\n\n# Summary\n\nThis is a quick fix for version [5.0](https://github.com/rectangle-dbmi/Realtime-Port-Authority/releases/tag/5.0), which is a response to Port Authority's API Error Message: \"Transaction limit for current day has been exceeded.\" \n\n# Official Statement for the App Being Down\n\nThere has been a misconception that since [5.0](https://github.com/rectangle-dbmi/Realtime-Port-Authority/releases/tag/5.0), we are now limiting the amount of times people can use the app. As you can see from the source code, this couldn't be farther from the truth. In fact, the only code that was changed was how we handled updates to the buses on the map. This does not affect how many calls are done on the app.\n\nPort Authority has a 10,000 request per day limit to their [TrueTime API](http://truetime.portauthority.org) per app. This is controlled by each app's API key. While the app currently has a special 500,000 request per day limit, we hit the limit on November 5 at 7:30PM.\n\nThe error message from Port Authority to us is \"Transaction limit for current day has been exceeded.\" Everytime this message comes up, **the app is out of commission until midnight when requests will be accepted again.**\n\n\"Why was the API suddenly blocked after 7:30PM?\" you may ask... While the route lines and stops are cached, every Monday and Friday, the cache is flushed and is re-cached. Each route download takes 1 API call. If you have 5 selected routes on Monday, your phone would do 6 requests to Port Authority -- 1 for the buses on the map, 5 for every route downloaded --. After this, the app will just do 1 API call per bus route updated (assuming you don't change your routes). \n\nWhen we first hit the 10,000 request limit 2 months after the app back in July, we (at the time @RitwikGupta and I) took this as a compliment. As the userbase increased, we kept thinking about this error message as a compliment. Since then, we have requested the API key 5 times successfully to eventually get 500,000 requests per day. Unfortunately, now that we have well over 10,000 users using the app, where each user has contributed well over 500,000 uses per day, this has now become a burden to all users, including me. I sincerely apologize for my arrogance regarding this problem, as I use this app daily, also.\n\nSince Port Authority doesn't seem to give developers usage numbers of the app, we are unable to predict when our app will go down because of over-usage. In addition, Port Authority told us we are only able to increase the usage request only if we have our app go down. Because of this, we have done our best on our side to mitigate the issue by requesting for another limit increase when the app's requests to the server get blocked.. We have also changed the app to say \"Port Authority server unavailable. Please check after midnight.\" This is only a quick fix, and we expect to have an update to gracefully handle this better (as well as other error messages) in the coming weeks.\n\nFrom this update, we ask users when this happens in the future to not add a review but instead just message us that the API is down.\n\n# Changes\n- Transform API error message \"Transaction limit for current day has been exceeded.\" to \"Port Authority server unavailable. Please check after midnight.\"\n"
