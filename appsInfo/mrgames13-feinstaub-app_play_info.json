Lot of UX problems but I believe developer will solve those annoyances, hopefully. Here are some of them: crazy color combinations that prevent users to see anything (unbelievable really :), no way to see exact values on graph, app doesn't save selection which parameters you want to see on graph, so you have to do it every time again and again. Lot more annoyances besides these, but I believe in developer...", 'Very useful tool for sensor.community', 'very good app and one of my favourites for checking my Luftaden sensors and their data. Detailed graphs for looking back at trends and straightforward to use. Recommended for Luftdaten sensor owners, as you can compare sensors and check pollution levels.', 'Great app, just what I need to easily check my sensor values mostly using their pretty neat widget. And if you ever need it, their support team is very reactive, right here in the play store.', 'This app keeps getting better. Great job on the graph redesign, devs!', 'Finally an app which respects users and doesnt only give some mysterious one number and a smiley/frowney face. THANK YOU!', 'One of the best (and few) apps for air pollution', "It's available in English.
