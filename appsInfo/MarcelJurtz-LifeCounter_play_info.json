If you pick a color for each side, clicking the reset button resets the life totals like expected, BUT the backgrounds get reset to black as well...', 'Simple!

Love it!', 'I really like the layout of this app.  Any chance of a history function being implemented in the future?', 'Simple yet functional and ad free. Perfect!', 'Works okay. Not that intuitive, or feature rich', "It's simple, but very useful", 'Simple and lovely. Free.', 'Minimal features. Very very basic score keeper', 'Simple. Amazing.', "Was really good, but latest update causes it to reset when you switch apps and go back. Makes it's unusable when you are in a game and want to rule check.", "Don't list this app as entertainment! The reviews are asking me if it had live channels, 4k films and filmographies. And, yes, great app, but I am rating 4 stars and uninstalling it just because the add/remove life buttons are small and kind of hard to hit. Yes, I am that lazy.", "I loved this app, very friendly with the memory usage and simple, nice colors. I really hope it would have more options for Commander or to track more counters like Energy, but it's just perfect for 1 on 1 matches. Highly recommended.", 'Would like to see some nicer colours but that is only a minor thing for me.. still rating this app 5 stars', 'Great, needs to keep state when closed.

Plz keep this ad free!! :)", 'This is the best of the life counter apps. Simple, no bullshit, no ads.
