But if you save after ther notes and profile, then edit the entry will the addition of a pic, it works.', "Fantastic app! I've been looking for an app i can keep track of my tastings and this works perfectly! the only thing I'd change that I have noticed so far would be the tasting wheel having additional marker points to be more specific.", "won't export my entries. app keeps shutting down during the process. pretty irritating for sure. lost all my entries because it wouldn't export. won't recommend this crappy app to anyone. DON'T DOWNLOAD, DON'T BUY!!!", "Basically useless when doing the flavor wheel, it doesn't save. Cant edit \nentries either.", 'Customizable, intuitive, unique.

Will start typing and can't save any Changed content.", 'I really thought this would be the app for me to record all of my whisky tasting notes. But it has one serious flaw. The search function is really basic. It appears that it does not search the contents of the notes field, let alone any custom fields you add. Likewise, the filter function is pretty much worthless. You can only filter by maker, origin, location, and a few date fields -- not by whiskey type. Lastly, they should add an inventory field and the ability to limit to whiskey in your collection.', 'Love the app, and the beer journal predecessor. The best tasting journal out there. I wish there was an IOS version, so I could use it on apple devices and because I have a lot of friends that would like it!', 'Love this app. I have one request. The light blue color of the rating stars is too light, it is difficult to see the difference between the ratings, especially the half-stars. I have a hard time distinguishing between some ratings. When I show the list to friends they say... "they are all rated the ssme". A darker blue, or something with better contrast would be nice.', 'Coffee journal upgrade, love having all tastings in a single place and ability to sync with other devices.', 'Wonderful, customizable journal for tasting, with so many details that can be recorded. Developer is quick to respond to questions. Worth the money!', 'Even better than previous Whisky Journal from Flavordex. I was able to export from that app to this one, using Google Drive. However, the info from Flavor Radar did not import, and when I edit to input it manually, the wheel is blank, no labels. So it looks like I will have to re-input all entries fresh, unless you have a fix? (Still 5 stars. It is truly a must-have app.)', 'Love it.
