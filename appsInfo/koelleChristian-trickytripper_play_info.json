If I can provide something to help you fix this problem for the future (or even repair my current transaction log), I would be very happy! Some kind of import function  would be great as well.', 'Very good app and one of a kind. Great work. I do find it odd that I am unable to select a date earlier than current month.', 'This software is very useful for trip', "Please include 1)reports in it like all the transactions related to a traveller 2)Wen we select custom split please keep check boxes beside persons n a check box on top of 'create' button to split evenly, which i guess wud be very comfrtabe..3) its very good app fr money management with roomies and while traveling, you could include some keywords, so that ur app will be in search list n will get good number of downloads.. thanks for App :)", 'If you could add a description field for transfer transaction same as the one for the payment to make some notes for what you transfer the money for the other person. Thanks and hope to see it soon', 'Been using this for 3 large family trips now.', "I never write reviews. But I have to do it for this app. I'm a very frequent traveller and that too with friends. This is the best app ( after trying lot many ) for the job . easy to use , very powerful , very convenient for ppl who travel on a sharing basis. Suggestions to the dev : 1. see if u can make it in different colour schemes 2. The types, if I could edit it and make my own 3. A Widget would be lovely to access 4. Format creation option for overall view would be lovely. Awesome work guys .", "Haven't left on the trip yet, will update rating on return. Only thing I can see missing is editing categories, but not huge with description available.", 'Thank you for creating such as useful apps. It really help me to organize budgeting when travel in a group. 5 stars if the payment source setting can be from more than 1 person.', 'Was just looking for this type of app. Thank you!', 'Especially liked the split expense reporting', 'Liked the way the expenses are managed', 'Simple and Perfect App', "When day outing with 3-4 friends its always difficult to keep the track of expenses by each person and dived the cost between @ the end. Tricky Tripper was a perfect solution for me cos i don't need full accounting facility  on this situation. Only drawback for me is that i cant have my currency type. I don't need currency exchange but like to have my currency type (Rs.) except for ($).  Export functionality is GREAT. and really useful for me to handle trip budgets. also the currency and default currency setting :)  New request:- when we adding new person after starting the trip the costs r not divided from that point onward. so can u make a way to update the previous costs to him also.", "...if you could only add the 'several currencies' feature. I want to enter the exchange rate globally and to add payments in other currency.", 'I have now tried all apps in this category and this one is the best. Simple and easy to use.

I think this application will help me to record ma expenses and track the expenses each person has made.', 'Amazing tricks', 'No dates, no currencies, no calculators...
