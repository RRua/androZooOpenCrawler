This app does the job.", 'Seems to be broken under Android 9, used it for years with previous versions. Hope it will be updated.', 'This app has given my battery a new life. It proves to me that WiFi is battery hungry', 'Does exactly what it says, brilliant!', 'this app is now a must have app for me! excellent app with widget that is truly useful!!!!', 'Took a few days to work out why it was turning Wi-Fi off while had the screen on. Seems the option to keep it on when in use affects when screen is on, not just when off as settings say. Happy with it now as s4 used default of 15 minutes before turning it off! Had one app not being recognized as white listed when it was.', 'Stop breaking it to demand I rate it. I hate G+ and intend to delete my account after this.   Your prompt to rate pauses parts of the app and gives no indication beyond not leaving wifi awake. Fix or stop bloody prompting me and the rating will be fixed to something more fitting to this app.', 'Since upgrading to android 5.1 the app has had trouble with airplane mode. I use a tasker script to toggle airplane mode while at work as I have poor signal. During times when airplane mode is on the app seems to not be able to alter the wifi state. Have you seen similar problems? Would debug logs be of any use to you in solving this?', 'that\'s what I\'m talking about, especially expert mode is awesome! That\'s what I\'ve been looking for. But small issue on good old Android Gingerbread is that your app is not an exception among the others that wifi "timed checks" sometimes cause wifi to disappear completely for some reason; so I had to disable this feature.', 'Saves me at least 30% of my battery life, once you change the settings it goes smoothly from there.
