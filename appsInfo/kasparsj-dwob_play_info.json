New update. It seems to now be stuck in a endless load. The application on start just remains in an endless loop of loading. Uninstalling and reinstalling only allows the app to load once and it works fine. However, if you close it and reopen it will just go into an endless load loop. Further, if you just leave thr application running eventually it will do the samething; an endless uodate loop. It is such an amazing application. The spoken Pali has such a crisp pronoucation.', "‚ù§Thank you so much for your wonderful app! I keep the widget on my phone's home screen and the daily quote keeps me at all times connected to the Dhamma.
