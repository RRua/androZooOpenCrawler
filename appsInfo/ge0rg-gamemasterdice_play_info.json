Good for serious game masters. Does not have roll effect so not good for graphics-oriented gamers. My favourite after trying out a dozen other dice apps.', 'Simple and efficient. Will track on a star if I can customize the default roll offerings.  Thank you for the freebie!   Edit: thanks for responding and letting me know I could long-press the default buttons to change their value. This is a sound and whole app.', 'I just wanted a simple method of generating PINs or making quick decisions (1d2) when feeling overwhelmed by analysis paralysis. This does the job perfectly.', "If you only need to roll single types of dice is great. But pools and odd sizes, not so much. Also, preloaded it has F dice, I couldn't find them in the selection of dice.", 'This app combines a very simple text ui with a fairly robust die configuration that should be suitable for almost any tabletop game. All that bundled up in a package that has no ads or permission requests.', 'The buttens are customizable. no advertisements. perfect.', 'Does what it should, no ads, nothing unnecessary.', "Doesn't let you roll the infamous d8+d12 used on many AD&D encounter tables. Won't let you run Star Wars:Edge of the Empire nor the current Marvel, as those dice pool systems use multiple types per roll, such as d6+d8+d8+d10. Doesn't allow for unusual dice types (d5, d7, d16, d30) nor the really rare d14 and d24. It's simple, and it's good for systems with only a few roll types; I'd hate to use it for WEG's d6 system or for Burning Wheel.", "For an app to replace the real thing, it requires the diversity of that thing; in this case, dice. You can't set faces other than the basic 7, you can't program special rolls like exploding dice in a pool or target scores, to name just a couple shortcomings. It's a fine app for simple rolls, but to live up to it's name will require much more work.", "You're able to choose what dice from a wide variety basically anything you need and you get to add modifiers to keep track of so if you have one attack you do all the time you have an easy time of rolling with the tax", 'Does exactly what I need and what it says it will do, without ads or data gathering. Thank you!', 'I wish it handle pool of dices and have some animations, but its simplicity is really nice.', 'Finally, a simple and powerful dice app without sound and 3D effects.
