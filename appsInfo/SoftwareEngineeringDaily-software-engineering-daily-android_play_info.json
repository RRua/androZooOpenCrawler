Does the app work exactly the same with Backend provided on the Github compared to production? I love it was written in Kotlin Coroutines. The configuration changes are solved! Love the exoplayer and how convenient the player is. Thank you. Making it open source helped a lot!', "Love this podcast, willing to give them a chance to get the rough edges out of the app. Search does not work, no results, no response. Attempt to register goes nowhere, just disables the button, no spinner, no response. Subsequent attempt to login, similar behavior. List of episodes has some styling issues. Maybe this was built first as an iPhone app? Keep at it! I'll try again another time.", "Hate to leave such a low review, but the app is borderline unusable. Doesn't keep track of where you were in an episode if it pauses when you turn your car off, both the time slider and skip buttons only work occasionally, and the search didn't return an episode as the first result when I searched for almost the exact title. I was able to find an older episode so I'm grateful for that and the podcast quality itself, but this app leaves a lot to be desired.", "love the podcast but the app doesn't work on my Samsung s8+. cant download, cant stream, can search. all this functions just lead to an eternal spinning. I'll look for it on github and see if I can help.", "I think some of the earlier issues have been resolved. It does save my place in the podcast. Love the 2x speed increase. I'm sure this app will get better and better!", 'super simple and perfessional frontend and content. with reliable backend app always works. good job', "Huge improvement with this recent app update! It's now much easier to find the episodes that you are looking for!", 'Edit: reinstalled the app and wow! Really impressed by the new design. Very usable and here is my 5 stars', 'the best podcast for developers, period', 'login is not functional.', "Doesn't play content.", 'does not work on Android', "doesn't play.", "Doesn't play"], 'appId': 'com.koalatea.sedaily', 'url': 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koalatea.sedaily&hl=en&gl=us'}
