\r\n\r\n\r\nfeatures:\r\n\r\n1,Use Hosts File on android devices with out root.So that can custom domain name \r\n   resolution records.\r\n2,support wildcard DNS records.for example:\r\n\r\n      127.0.0.1 a.com\u3000\u3000|\r\n      127.0.0.1 b.a.com\u3000 |   => 127.0.0.1 .a.com\r\n      127.0.0.1 c.b.a.com  |\r\n\r\n3,full support ipv6 network , support change AAAA (Ipv6 Address) DNS records. example:\r\n\r\n      :: \u3000b.com\u3000\u3000\r\n      2001:A124::6666\u3000c.com\r\n     fc00:aaaa:bbbb:cccc:1111:2222:3333:1234\u3000 www.d.com\r\n     fe80::2\u3000c.b.a.com  \r\n\r\n4,maybe more power saving when the records too much,because can use wildcard DNS records. such as google domain, only  need  one record  ".google.com " that can  represents all the subdomains.\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n\r\n1,make the hosts file by self or get  from Internet.\r\n2,put the file into your  phone anywhere you can choose or accessible. \r\n3,start app. click the blue button where at the bottom of the scree , then select the hosts file which you make or get from Internet.\r\n4, click the big white button  which like a switch for  running and the white button will turn
