This app has no adds and is extensible.', 'Open Source and adfree, perfect.', 'Most recent update is a step backwards, with no way to skip the ugly new homescreen, numpad color customization now a mess, and puzzle list thumbnails no longer adopting puzzle theme colors. Stop tinkering with what was a nice, simple app that just worked, unchanged, for years. Why the need to constantly add silly new features?', 'Last few updates have easily made this my favourite. The import feature lets me quickly import guardian and times sudoku into a decent interface. Killer feature is "undo to last mistake". Gives you a real opportunity to learn from your mistakes.', 'Old version is better.. This update keeps forcing unwanted changes', 'I had used the original version of this for many years until it stopped working on my last Android update. So glad I found this fork. This game is so much more functional than any of the other Sudoku apps. And open source to boot!', 'Fantastic! A long press on back brings up the menu! So this is what Open Source is all about.

Top notch display of real open source spirit.', 'Great dark themed version of the original.', 'The best soduko.', 'If you like sudoku, this is the only app that you will ever need. Brilliant app and no annoying ads', "I've tried numerous sudoku apps and this one has it all (except for its complete lack of ads)", "Dark theme is great.  However I would love either customizable color or at least a full black and grey theme.  Also a bug that still exist since Masek's version causes Undo to Checkpoint not to work. When save checkpoint is used from a resumed game without changing any data, it won't save and you can't undo to checkpoint.", "The game is great. Just crashes sometimes when opening the menu, causing loss of game play which is super annoying. Also saving checkpoint doesn't always work.", 'Best sudoku game available on Android', 'This is by far the best Sudoku I\'ve found on Android. Pros: Ad-free, lots of options for input style, nice UI.
