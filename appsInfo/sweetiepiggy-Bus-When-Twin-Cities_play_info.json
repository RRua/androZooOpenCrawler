But I've been getting an error lately. Java.security.cert.certpathvalidatorException: Trust anchor for certification path not found.", 'Awesome app! Incredible support! TBH my life is a little better because this app gives me answers as to when the bus is supposed be there. Wish you folks had a tip jar to show my appreciation.', 'Awesome small app that does exactly what a Metro Transit user needs it to. Easiest way to check your stop and bus.', "It works great and thanks for adding some theme options! I'm increasing this to five stars.", "bless this app. simple, intuitive, accurate. do y'all have a PayPal because I would gladly give you money", "Looks to be quite usable! Like the real time map feature. Wish we could merge additional routes into the selected set; also it'd be great if, when zoomed in on map so that bus stops are shown, we could click on a stop and see which buses stop there without already knowing its stop number. But I look forward to using this app!", "This is the perfect app for those of us that commute to work by bus in the Minneapolis/St. Paul downtown areas! It's exactly what I was looking for. I love the option to select which buses show up in large and small print at a favorite stop. I like how if you turn your phone to landscape I can see both the schedule and the bus map at the same time.", "Update: I posted my original review March 29 and BAM! The very next day it saves my settings! I am discovering something new and awesome with this app every time I use it! Thank you so much! 5 Stars!!!! I love this app! So why didn't I give it 5 stars? When I remove buses from a stop it defaults back once I exit that stop or close the app. I wish the settings would stay how I set it up.", "It is quick and painless to find my stops. The favorite feature is smooth. Better than navigating metro transit's app or website", 'Finally! An app that not only remembers stop numbers, but lets me label them with something memorable. No more wondering which stop is #32761', 'This is the best app for metro transit buses. you can save your stops for easier look-up & see where the bus currently is and how long before it arrives. Very easy to use.', "Not as nice or full featured as OneBusAway in Seattle, but much, much better than Metro Transit's official app. If I didn't have OneBusAway to compare it to, it'd be 5 stars.", 'Excellent app with but location! Updates made it really intuitive to find your bus stops via searching route. Must have app!!', 'I like that I can see the location of the bus. that allows me to know where the bus exactly is!', 'Love the app. Easier to use than the official one.', 'Simple and fast', 'I use it for every commute', 'Excellent app!!!'], 'appId': 'com.sweetiepiggy.buswhentwincities', 'url': 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sweetiepiggy.buswhentwincities&hl=en&gl=us'}
