{'title': 'Ltt.rs - Open Source Email client (JMAP)', 'description': 'Ltt.rs (pronounced Letters) is a proof of concept email (JMAP) client currently in development. It makes heavy use of Android Jetpack for a more maintainable code base than some of the preexisting Android email clients.\r\n\r\n<b>To use Lttrs you need a JMAP (JSON Meta Application Protocol) capable mail server!</b>\r\n\r\nFeatures & Design considerations:\r\n\r\n· Heavily cached but not fully offline capable. Ltt.rs makes use of JMAP’s great caching capabilities. However actions, such as marking a thread as read, need a round-trip to the server until their consequences like unread count are updated. Ltt.rs will ensure that the action itself won’t get lost even if performed while momentarily offline.\r\n· No settings aside from account setup. Settings invite feature creep and make the app hard to maintain. Ltt.rs aims to support one specific work flow. Users who desire a different work flow may find K-9 Mail or FairEmail more suitable.\r\n· Minimal external dependencies. Third party libraries are often of poor quality and end up being unmaintained. Therfore we will only rely on well known, well tested libraries from reputable vendors.\r\n· Autocrypt as a first class feature¹. With its strict UX guidelines autocrypt fits right into Ltt.rs.\r\n· Ltt.rs is based on jmap-mua, a headless email client, or a library that handles everything an email client would aside from data storage and UI. There is also lttrs-cli which uses the same library.\r\n· When in doubt: Look at Gmail for inspiration.\r\n\r\n¹: Planned feature\r\n\r\nLtt.rs is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.
