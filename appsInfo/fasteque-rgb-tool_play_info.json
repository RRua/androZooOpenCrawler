Decimal I can use for the RGBA function. I don't know if there's any rgbo function. So I have to figure out how to convert the 'o' value to a percentage. I like the hex input method. The only thing I would change is an option to hide the Android icon so only the selected color shows.", "This is almost perfect, the only things I would suggest would be to have a sample of the color showing when using the color picker tool. You can't see where exactly the tool is hitting, when it gives you the values you can't be sure what color it is selecting you until you save it. I would also love to have the option of using a color wheel with slider bars to select opacity.", 'This app is helpful for matching the icons, widgets, etc on your homescreen to suit the colours of your wallpaper. (Just screenshot your home screen and use it as the image to extract the colours from). The colour palette feature- where the main colours present in the image (and their RGB codes) are automatically selected- is a nice touch. The only thing is that it would be good if there was a way to copy the RGB values onto the clip board.', "Simple and effective, with some suggestions for improvement, a segmented screen to display multiple  adjustable (sliding) swatches. A before and after view, ie; a grid layout with selectable areas. As a designer I require a range of colours when creating site templates. Perhaps with an option to overlay the swatch references on it's respective swatch. Otherwise a great tool for anyone working with colour.
