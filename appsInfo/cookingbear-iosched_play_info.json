The only apps from Google to have issues with this is I/O 2019, the newest update to Google Contacts (it worked prior to latest update), and the new update to Google Calculator.  Google Play Games is the best version of dark mode implemented - it respects A) Battery Saver, B) Night mode (auto or manual), and C) colors the navigation bar the same color as the theme.', "I look forward to updating to five stars as soon as this bug is fixed. I had thought the problem was the sign-in, but that's not it. Upon opening it this morning, I was already signed in. Every time the app loads, I see the seconds counter change once and when it tries to change the second time, the old digit disappears but the slot just stays white as the app crashes. I think it's a coincidence and the app crashes 2-5 secs after the UI fully displays. Motorola X Pure, Build 25.211.1 Good luck!", "The schedule is terrible. Going to event details and back resets your scrolling position. There are way too many events for this simple list representation and filtering doesn't help much. Search is a joke when you try to find a session because there are many of them with the same name and you have to go to details to see the time, the list is not sorted by time either. Shuttle bus schedule is missing from the app so you have to go to the web version to see it.", "For being an app from Google, this is astonishingly bad.
