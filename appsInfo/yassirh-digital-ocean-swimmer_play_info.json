I've used this alot, even though it could have done with other features added. But for a few app, it was great. However a recent upgrade has made it basically useless. It's not even correctly picking up recent droplets that I've created. Maybe just teething problems with the new release and planned feature sets, but it's a major step backwards.", "The interface isn't particularly intuitive and the on/off indicator doesn't update with the droplet state, but otherwise it's a useful app that does what it's supposed to.", "It's open source, end of freakin' story. Does pretty much everything that the DO website does, often faster and easier. If you need to use the DO firewall, the app doesn't do that, but grow up and harden your own dang server. I never review apps, but this Digital Ocean Swimmer is the bomb-diggity. It's so great it forces me to use early 90s slang to describe it. I'm seething because I didn't make this app. Hannoun Yassir is CHANGING THE GAME. Digital Ocean needs to sponsor this man posthaste.", 'After shut down/poweron status does not updates, I can see refreshed status only after restarting the app. Also fingerprint auth screen leaks of current list of droplets (visible through background semitransparent fingerprint prompt window)', 'Amazing app to manage all my droplets on the go!', 'Functional - could just use a few more of the newer DO features (and maybe, eventually, a UI update). Great product though :)', "Would be nice if it didn't rely on an external ssh client to make connections. Please consider integrating one, with support for a user's ssh key as per DO dashboard.", "While click on reboot droplet no process show. don't know process when start and when complete. and Try to Restore from images not work..", 'Certificate is expired. 14/04/2019 certificate issue fixed, thank you!', 'Only provides basic administrative functions. Would be more useful if it provided File Manager FTP access.', 'Would love to try it, but attempting to login redirects me to a server with an expired certificate. :(', 'Great mobile management tool.', 'the fact the dev has put this on GitHub is worth 5 stars alone. More OSS in the PlayStore please.', 'Good app for overview', 'works well! life saver for the sys admin', 'this app is very useful', 'Only basic droplet and DNS management without other resources and no recent updates.', 'fake apps', 'Awesome!', 'Doesn\'t work. Tried logging in but it just opens the phone\'s default web \nbrowser asking you to sign in there, and when you do it doesn\'t redirect \nback to the app, just redirects to a web version of the dashboard with a \n"something went wrong" error message. Going back to the app then brings you \nback to the beginning of the process with the log in prompt.', 'Provides all the functionality I need. I especially like the ease of jumping into an SSH session in JuiceSSH. Only negative for me is that the interface leaves a bit to be desired.', 'I would like to be able to see the graphs for cpu, mem, hdd.
