Love this alternate to solitaire.', "my dismal review is due to your vetting of ad operations.  as most other programs you believe that ads should turn off my web radio which i listen to while playing a game. I agree that ads support you but not at my loss of choice. have unobtrusive ads and maybe i'll re-rate.", 'Great game - seems very easy even on hard mode.
