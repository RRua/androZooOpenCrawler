It along with pinboard is the solution I have been looking for for years. The developer is friendly, fast to respond and resolve issues.", "It's a good looking app that does the job very well. You just need your Pinboard API key and you're off! I really like being able to share to Pinboard via this - superb!", 'Brilliant app. Totally worth it. Developer deserves kudos for this effort! Keep up the good work!', "I used this app in 2019.I have been using this app more frequently lately. The developer is very receptive to feedback. I highly recommend it to all pb fans. I think it's not widely used because it is very difficult to find when u do a Google search. Developer can consider contacting pb owner to get his app listed on his resources page. Right now there is only one android app.", 'Best pinboard client on the play store!', "When saving a bookmark, I'd really like to be able to enter tags and a description. Right now the app saves silently and I have to switch away from the browser to Pinkt, find the bookmark, edit it, show the description, and only then can I properly tag and describe it. Other than that, no ads and open source! Will keep an eye on development!", "First impressions good... I like the API method of connecting to the service. Would like to see the 'popular' bookmarks open to all not just my own that are marked public. Nice looking app. (edit, 5 stars to encourage new users to try the app, thanks for the response)", "My goodness ‚Äî what an update. Everything I asked for got implemented! Legend! The popular bookmarks page works great; there's even a setting to edit tags and descriptions before you save popular bookmarks to your personal collection!", 'I like the UI a lot! The only things missing are an option to immediately open an entry iny browser, and mark it as read without having to load it. Both of these are kind of necessary on slow connections.', 'No Complaints, Works Like A Dream: I will definitely recommend this app for anyone who is looking to quickly save many a universe of web data that, frankly, is disappearing fast. Thanks!', "A wonderful Pinborad client on Android. Easy to use with modern design. Please keep up the good work. Would be happy to make donations to help support the app's development!", 'Sometimes fails to save page because of "invalid URL"', "Download this one! This is the best app I've downloaded in a while, as well as the best pinboard app on iOS or Android! I wish I could support the developer---independent app development is alive on Android!", 'Finally, a pinboard client that works and is beautiful! The syncing behavior of PinDroid drove me nuts.', 'The best Pinboard App for Android. Latest updates have made it the only App I use for my bookmarking. Well done!', 'Still has some kinks to work out but the developer is very responsive.', 'very easy to use, efficient, and just works as needed. 5 stars.', 'Best Pinboard app for Android, no question.', 'Great app. Do you plan to fetch the notes as well?', 'Now the best pinboard app on Android.', 'Pinboard junkie.
