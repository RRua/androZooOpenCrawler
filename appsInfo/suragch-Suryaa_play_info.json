{'title': 'Suryaa', 'description': "Suryaa is a flashcard memory app for learning traditional vertical script Mongolian. (If you are learning Cyrillic Mongolian, then I recommend using a different app). \r\n\r\nWhen you come across a new word, you can add it to your vocabulary list. Then the app will used spaced repetition to help you review words at the appropriate times. This program does not come pre-installed with practice vocabulary (except for three example words). Rather, it is a tool to use while you study. \r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n- Easy to create new lists and new flashcards.\r\n- When adding cards there is a Mongolian keyboard and an IPA (phonetic) keyboard\r\n- You can also optionally record audio if you are working with a tutor\r\n- Uses spaced repetition (The more difficult the word, the more often you review it. And the easier the word, the less often you will see it.)\r\n- Can import and export audio and text\r\n- You can choose if you want the question to show you the Mongolian, the definition, or the pronunciation/audio.\r\n\r\nWhen shown the answer to a question, you are asked to grade yourself on a scale of 0-5. Based on your response, you will see that word more or less often in the future. Here is what each of the numbers mean:\r\n\r\n5 - You got the answer right. It was easy.\r\n4 - You got the answer right, but recalling it took a slight hesitation.\r\n3 - You got the answer right, but recalling it took considerable effort.\r\n2 - You got the answer wrong, but when you saw the right answer you realized it was easy.\r\n1 - You got the answer wrong, but when you saw the right answer you remembered learning it before.\r\n0 - You didn't know the answer at all.\r\n\r\nBest wishes to you in your Mongolian study.
