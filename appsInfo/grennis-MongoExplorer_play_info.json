Also,  please provide the following feature - sync db every 15 minutes and allow us to set alert notification on a collection for events like new row created, row modified, value of column set above a particular limit, etc.  Notifications are very useful to notify developer of any new important event.  Also, how safe are our db credentials if we use it in your app? you can literally tamper with our data without our knowledge? are we in safe hands?', 'App is awesome.
