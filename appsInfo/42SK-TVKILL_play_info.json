{'title': 'TV KILL - Universal IR Remote', 'description': "This app enables you to turn off any TV with your device's built-in infrared blaster.\r\n\r\nHave you ever imagined what it would be like if you could turn off any TV?\r\nWith TV KILL, you can!\r\n\r\nTV KILL gives you the ability to shut down any TV, no matter where you are.\r\nSimply aim your phone at a TV and press the off-button.\r\nYour phone will then start transmitting a variety of off-signals for different TVs and one of them will turn off the TV in front of you, just like the famous TV-B-Gone remote.\r\n\r\nIf you activate the repetitive-mode, your phone will transmit the off signals over and over again, even when you close the Application or lock your screen.\r\nThis way, you can simply deploy your phone in front of a TV and the TV will turn itself off again whenever somebody tries to switch it on.\r\n(Great for private screening events)\r\n\r\nYou can also select an off-pattern that only affects devices from a single manufacturer, in case you want to turn-off a TV from a specific brand, \r\n\r\nTV KILL also includes a widget for your home screen, so you don't even have to open the app to turn a TV off.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you should find a TV which the app can't turn off or if you can't turn off ANY TV at all although your device has got a working IR blaster, please contact us and we will see to it that the TV/device is supported in the next TVKILL version.\r\n\r\nYou may also use our issue-tracking-site to submit bug reports and feature

This is a great replacement to TV Terminator which is longer in the app store. Has a big datebase and the repetitive mode is great.', 'After 15 days installed , Malwarebytes showed me the truth , spyware !!! It uses the simple technique , let it stay for a while and sudenly 8t pushs the malware. Watchout people !!!!', 'Good, But not works for Xiaomi MiTV4A This app will be helpful for power it up. Try making a qs tile for turn on/off the tv', 'The only app that works on my old TV. I would recommend and appreciate it if additional buttons can be added to make it a full remote control, not just the off button.', 'Needs code updates. Please add more brands, more models. Works on a few TVs, but not enough.', "Amazing tool for trolling sports watching bar patrons (don't do that, use it to turn off the TV when it's family quality time and they don't stop paying attention to the telly)", "I can't seem to get it to work on my LG V20 and my Toshiba TV as a test. Other IR remote apps work just fine.", 'Successfully turned TV on and off. Useless after that. Will give more stars if a button is added to change input mode. And volume buttons. At a minimum.', "I've only tried 3 tv's and it's turned off all of them brilliant", 'simple design and free stars for that, sadly didnt turn off my sony or toshiba tv', 'Malwarebytes reports this as trojan - beware', 'worked first time straight away as soon as pressed tv went of perfect üëå', 'So simple, works, wonderful.', 'not sure why it doesnt work :( phone is mi a2 lite pie 9.0', 'Wonderful app, not compatible with Samsung S10 e. Why not?', 'excellent tool for fast remote finding', 'Works 98% of the time', "Perfect for killing annoying TV's. Does the job perfectly!", '–ö—Ä—É—Ç–æ!', 'Fail', 'Good working', 'Awesome', 'Awesome! This is a dream come true =) One suggestion -- it would be great if there was a "stealth mode". The big read "off" button is easy to see and I have to be extra ninja not to get caught using this. If, for instance, there was an option to bring up, say, a generic email-looking page with a few words as the button (press here for peace), then this could be used while others who are looking over your shoulder or glancing over think you\'re just up to routine phone stuff.  I always wanted a "TV-Be-Gone", and was so excited to see this new option. Thank you!!!', "works like a charm most of the time for example in bars, cafes, \nrestaurants, airports, shops, basically everywhere there is propaganda or \ntoo much noise / a shame that the most new smartphones don't have IR anymore", 'UI looks a bit outdated (Android 4.x style) but the app does what it claims and successfully turns off at least Samsung TVs. Failed to turn off Thompson TV.', 'Awesome app.  TVs at your table in a restaurant, no good.  This app killed it on the first try.  Well played!', 'it is so usefull one time i lost my remote and nowadays tv dont have on/off button this app really helped me', 'App is awesome! Works really well with my LG G3.

Had to enable additional patterns in settings to work on 2015 Vizio M60", 'I love it, works with most popular brands so far. I wish I can select certain brands in Repetitive mode', 'It doesnt work on all tvs, just the brands that are common or well known. 2 stars cause i like the layouts. I have a dynex tv.', 'Works like a charm and looking forward to using it at the next noisy Airport lounge.', "Didn't even work", 'Turn off the news everywhere you go!', 'lol', 'Awesome'], 'appId': 'com.redirectapps.tvkill', 'url': 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.redirectapps.tvkill&hl=en&gl=us'}
