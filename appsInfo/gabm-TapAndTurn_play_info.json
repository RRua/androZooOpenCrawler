It's laggy in performance... After system boot it's not wake up automatically, sometimes it wake automatically but it's not hiding the bubble from screen. It shows the bubble continuously after system boot sometimes. No option to select some apps work in default orientation. While this app ON the landscape games also locked with portrait then we need select to landscape but here the game screen stretches from vertical screen to horizontal. that looks lstreching a 9:16 to wide.", 'Actually: i want to love it, but it is totally unreliable. Despite Battery exclusion & Permanent notification, the service consistently dies and cannot be resurrected without launching the app. very broken and apparently ABANDONED 2018 ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ i love it. thank you!', 'It worked great...when it actually worked. It kept turning itself off, rendering it useless. I uninstalled it after having it only a few hours.', "Android 9, Oneplus 6. Works, stops, restart, works briefly. This is only 1 of 2 apps with the approval for each turn. I used Adaptive Rotation for years. It's no longer on Play store. Transferring it with APK does not work with Pie. ..", "Perfect!!! Thank you for this!! I was so sick of it rotating when I didn't want it to!! This lets me choose to rotate so quickly and easily, without changing settings!!!", 'Great app. Please keep it free. Please add option to have de button in center-center, center-left, right-center, etc. (all five positions). Thank you.', 'Works great, i have this feature on my s10 and i Now have it on my older devices thanks to this app', 'I wanted to use this with gesture mode on my OnePlus because the Android one only works with three-button setup. However, despite service running, the icon seldom shows and I cannot really use this.', "great idea but very buggy. once you use the rotation arrow the app has a mind of its own and rotates randomly. pity as this is close to exactly what I've always wanted", 'Works beautifully immediately when launched, but stops within minutes. Service is enabled config is correct.', 'Does not work in oppo color os, when you turn the device it displays the icon but when you tap the icon nothing happen, i tried changing the setting and stuff but the problem is the app not the settings', "The only app I ever actively looked to donate to / buy pro version of.

If it fixes the functionality lost with adaptive rotation lock broken on nougat, I'll be very happy. Please add opacity control and the ability to center the icon on the screen--the center can usually be reached with the same hand holding a tablet when reading in bed, but the corner depends on which side you're on. Allowing the screen to reverse could also be useful.", "Works as advertised, does what it says it does, but comes with a major flaw - it overrides all screen orientation, not just auto-rotate. Does a great job of preventing the screen from rotating while I'm laying on my back reading, but when I launch a game or app that requires a particular rotation, it prevents it from rotating. Several of my apps either crash or cannot be used, and for some of them rotating the screen after they load does not fix them. End result is the app ends up causing more problems than it fixes.  If you want to always control screen orientation, no matter what, this app will do it. But if you want to rein in an overly sensitive auto-rotate, then give it a pass, because it will break any app that requires a particular orientation.", "THIS WILL MAKE YOUR LIFE EASIER! You won't have to change rotation in the notification bar anymore. Love it.  Used to use Adaptive Rotation Lock, but it hasn't been updated in years and does not work with Pixel 2 XL, this app does the same thing but works better, plus the screen overlay is in the top corner, making it much easier to use.", 'This is a must have app! It tames unintentional screen rotation by presenting an icon to confirm. Seriously great!', 'Buggy and randomly turns itself info at random.
