It also lacks a lot of the information that phpsysinfo gives in the browser. This app has a lot of promise, but it needs more development to be really useful. At this point you might as well open the browser on the phone and point it to your website.  EDIT: A little over a year later, this app has improved tremendously and was updated to address my gripes--something every user should respect, as developers don't always have the time to wade through wave after wave of us just to address our critique of their work.
