If it works through Samba I don't see why it shouldn't work on Android, unless I have to setup different drivers and I don't know that...", "Really good developer support but it is still not working. I have supplied the CUPS server ip address but it still hasn't found any printers. The number of times I need to print from my phone is so small it'll be easier for me to email whatever I want to print to myself and print from a device where ipp and CUPS works.

Anyone reading this, if you have a CUPS project use this app, don't fall for the other rubboshly made apps. This developer is outstanding, been looking for this a long time.

No configuration was required on the phone itself. Wonderful app, thank you.', 'It does work fine with Fedora Linux CUPS server for me. Although I had to add the printer by its explicit URL, not even specifying CUPS server IP address helped.
