The labels jump and flicker constantly, and regardless of this it is hard to identify which peak it belongs to. The free PeakLens app works flawlessly, and the pay-for PeakFinder is the best, imo (although PeakLens might be easier to use).', "This app is a hidden gem. It does exactly what it says it will do. Screen shots might be a nice idea but if it ain't broke don't fix it. I've been recommending it to my friends this evening and it's teaching me the names of hills around my own home that I didn't know. Absolutely a 5* app.", 'Looks like a great app, but my cheap phone (galaxy core prime) does not have a compass sensor :(', 'Allows you to work out mountains and hills in the distance. Great communication with author too.', 'this is a great help to identify peaks - filter by distance & height to focus on an area -', 'Seems to work except the camera is upside down. Is there a setting to flip the view?', 'Wonderful app. Very useful. Great job.', "This is a great start and I'm really looking forward to future improvements. The ability to take screenshots of the view will be nice. Even just being able to freeze the view would be helpful. I'd like to see some preferences build in so the font color/size can be changed. On a cloudy day the white font is hard to read in camera mode.  What I'd really love to see is the ability to capture a scene, recall it later and be able to interact with it. If I could zoom into a picture and see the names appear on more distant peaks as I zoom towards them in the picture, that would be pretty cool.", 'Good start', 'After I got the calibration correct it was dead-on accurate and could identify even the smallest Hills on the horizon. Well done!', 'Now I know the names of all those hills around me.', 'Great app to help orientation when in hills.', "[updated: the database problem has been fixed (very quickly)] The introduction text is really too long for such a simple app. Should just directly display the calibration the first time and the user can read the help text later if he wants to.  The FOV calibration should make it more clear that there is a red band on the border. Didn't notice it first. In addition once you've tapped, the text should update (to say that the second part of the calibration is going on), to let the user know that the tap was registered. Unfortunately, it seems my phone doesn't have enough RAM for the app to run smoothly so I couldn't test it further. Nevertheless the idea seems good and it's open source  so I give 3 stars :-)", 'not works', 'The compass did not work.
