A programmable sequence for frequently repeated tasks that require opening various apps. The shortcut creator is good, but usually it does the same as starting the app by its icon.', "This app saved me after SEVERAL hours of searching for a way to copy my Google Drive backup data from my old phone to my new phone without having to factory reset it again. Wasn't able to restore my data at first because I didn't have access to WiFi but Google allows absolutely no way to do so after the fact. Not to mention the backup feature itself doesn't work unless you disable lock screen security/smart lock on your phone. But a random forum pointed me here and it worked beautifully. Thanks!", 'Best in this case! Open source and good working! Just one option i need maybe you can add to this. Making and sending shortcats as file to other people and import shortcat file options!', 'Please provide bookmarking option of favourite shortcuts. Also it rescans everytime, instead add refresh option, so that we can manually refresh whenever needed because most of times only system shortcuts are needed.', 'After opening the app if i switch to landscape mode it crashes. And from landscape to potrait mode it crashes.', 'Took help from a person online to fix my issue of Night Light mode. They suggested this to search a menu option. Fixed my issue. Thanks.', "Amazing ! Only 200 kb size, no ads, no internet access permission, no unnecessary permission required to run, only do its work which is to create home screen shortcut of app's activities. Working perfectly in android 9.", 'I am 100% clueless how this app is overshadowed by that other quick app. This one is the only one that should exist. In fact if you are a dev and read this, do not EVER make a short cut app. If you have already, then you can build some water and air next. throw in a few ads and nobody will ever know. Some things are just done. This makes perfect look bad. Thank you.', 'Finally an activity launcher app that lists attributes such as package and class. Time saver, useful for sending intents from Tasker/Macrodroid.', "Really good app. It gives me a control over apps that would otherwise be impossible... Good interface and easy to get the hang.. .... Google what this app can do, if you realise then that this app is something you want to try, you won't be dissapointed... Imho this is the best at what it does... ... ... I'm not just blowing smoke, I love this app (did you realise that yet?üòâ)", 'This app is great!

Not once have I experienced any bugs while using this app, keeping in mind that not all activities are launchable per device. If you have trouble than this type of app is above you. It has worked perfectly on several devices I have owned, but of course i have not owned them all. So if it doesn't meet your expectations, uninstall or get a new Android.", "Hi, Please help me how to revert back from merging my internal storage with SD card there's no option for this. I want to do this coz I cant update my MUI now.", "Does only what it was created for, listing and launching various activities of all the apps installed on your device. Nothing More... Nothing Less... If you don't know what activities or intents in an android app are, the this app isn't for you & me :P", "It does exactly what it says. A beautiful app. Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is it crashes when the orientation is changed.

One bad thing is not showing running services after uptdate.', 'Not happy at all, forget about launching the activity, it is not even showing the particular activity which i wish to launch. It is showing only 3 activities of the app Dictomate, whereas it has about 13 activities.', 'This app worked perfectly to link to some hidden settings in my Xiaomi phone settings app the manufacturer hid. Worked flawlessly and even allowed customisation of the icon and name.', "To be honest I have no idea what this could be used for other than following a YouTube tutorial that told me to download it and I'd be able to put RCS on my T-Mobile LG G6. It worked great! I am now RCS equipped! Thanks!", 'I wish I could rate it 10 stars..
