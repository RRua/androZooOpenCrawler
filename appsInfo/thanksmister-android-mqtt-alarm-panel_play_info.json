Great job.', "VERY nice solution for integrating a control panel into home automation systems. Once I read the guide and got my head around the roles of the clients, I had no problem getting it to work with HomeSeer via Michael McSharry's brilliant mcsMQTT plugin. Installed on a new Fire 7 and mounted on the wall. Perfecto! Great work on this app dev. Hey, Thanks Mister!", "I really struggled to get the camera feed working until I realized that the camera feed only works when you don't have the settings up. The app should definitely make that more clear. The app also does not show the correct IP address, just an example one. But it presents that example IP address as if it were the correct IP address. I imagine it would be fairly trivial for the developer to add the actual IP address so if that's possible it would be appreciated!", "This guy is a champion. I was going to develop something very similar for myself but he's done everything I planned to do and more! It's simple and clean and has everything you need. It hooked right up to my MQTT Broker with Home Assistant and worked immediately.", 'Really useful for a tablet I have mounted on the wall. Using with a RabbitMQ broker to Home Assistant.', "Promising but if you enter MQTT settings incorrectly the popup warning keeps reloading so you can't get to the settings screen.   Would be great if you could use a webcam connected to the USB OTG so you could record in a location away from the device, such as having a camera outside.", 'On an Android ARM tablet, everything is fine. Fantastic application! But on an Android x86 with Android 5, it loses the connection to the MQTT server if it changes any option of any configuration. Only this is solved by restarting the application. :(', 'Great app! Not able to enter 23016 as port on MQTT server, I believe it is only allowing 4 digits. Is it by design? Thanks!', 'Very nice start. Unfortunately i tried using the browser functionality to load HA Lovelace UI and it does not work. Would have used the app full time if itndid', 'Awesome addition to HASS. Easy to intrgrate into a custom MQTT alarm pannel component. Packed full of features too!', 'Lean, simple and fast. Perfect for my application.', 'I love this app but i just updated it and it stopped working if you could please help, I can give you some info if needed but its worked great up until this update', 'Nothing works!', 'Excelent app  Would it be nice to have it for iPhone too. Any idea if there is any similar app I can use there?', 'Hands-down the best alarm control panel for Home Assistant!', 'The fingerprint unlock function is exactly what I needed. Is it possible to \ndisplay the HA website as main screen when the alarm has been disarmed \nwithout swiping from the right? So when disarmed opening the app will send \nyou straight to the HA website. Also, any plan for a kiosk mode? Thanks', 'Excellent app and the app is updated and improved regularly. A must have if \nyou have a HomeAssistant running as an alarm system also.', 'A prefect integration into my HomeAssistant ecosistem', 'Great design and super simple to set up!', 'Great app makes creating an alarm system with some door/window breaks and a few motion detectors very cheap and efficient. I love the design as well. The UI is very minimal but crams all the info needed for an alarm panel with access too home assistant with a simple swipe. I love it!', "Fantastic app, I've been using it as our main alarm panel since it was released. We have a wall tablet that is always on (screensaver with clock is a great feature) and the app has been working flawlessly!", "2 star for Android things I just started also to learn 1 star for having on Android and things tab but 2star deduct as your app is hang while couple of navigation it's horrible experience as being developer. Location for weather statistic and backward nav hang on some point. Moreover, I have experienced your app is just for landscape as an experience I notice while nav in menus I missed few scrolling list view I didn't notice does they exist. But at the last nav I notice you have scrolling list view that was easily experience if it will be in portrait mode you should not fix it for Android app but for tablet definitely it's awesome.  I hope you take this view as a testing design and improve your app. Don't waste my critical feedback as I spend my 1 hour for whole these things.", 'It is great as it is and does what it is supposed to do but I think it could be improved.  One thing I noticed is that the password for homeassistant is not saved and has to be retyped every time.  It also would be amazing if you could make it possible to show a couple of mqtt sensor states on the screen saver together with the clock. I would use that to show the state of one of my mqtt temperature sensors and maybe the outside temperature. However, it already is great and works very well! Good job!', 'Love that it is not tied to homeassistant but can be used with any mqtt setup!', 'Looks and works great, you should add a mode to make it work in portrait mode and use it as a handheld remote.'], 'appId': 'com.thanksmister.iot.mqtt.alarmpanel', 'url': 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thanksmister.iot.mqtt.alarmpanel&hl=en&gl=us'}
