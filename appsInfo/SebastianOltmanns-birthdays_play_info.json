LOVE the simplicity of this app. But it has one major flaw rendering it unusable to me...you HAVE to enter a birth year. There are plenty of people I know who dont want to share that (and it would be rude to ask). So sad about this!! If it's fixed, this would go from 2 to 5 stars easy in my book!!", "It's exactly what I want however I am not receiving push notifications for my entries. I have the notifications turned on, the app permissions for notifications is turned on, and app has access to storage. I'm using a Pixel2 running Android 9.0 maybe you could look into this please. You have one of the cleanest and least intrusive birthday manager app I've been looking for but without getting the notifications it's unfortunately no use to me ðŸ˜” Thank you.", 'App is ok but would be better if when you clicked on each person you could have a check list of gift ideas that you could then mark off once brought', 'This app has a iot of potential. The only thing it needs is a theme changing posibility: colors and background (black/white/photo) and a great transparent widget. Thanks to the. develiper for doing an app that does not track or need your lifetime privacy to show you a birthday.
