I love whoever made this!', "Should show all possible paths so people don't get lost in EIT", 'I like the idea, but I feel like the instructions overlapping the map makes it difficult to navigate because not everyone is knowledgeable about every building (for example first year students).', 'It\'s pretty nice could use some UI/UX changes.   The image for stairs up/down needs to be more apparent and maybe not circle as it\'s hard to notice in the clutured UW map.   Adding "covered walk ways okay" option like the one between MC and QNC or QNC and B2 is good. Could also benefit from more buildings (I get most of the others you\'re SOL for staying inside). Finally, viewing it on Google maps in stead of Waterloo maps would be cool', 'This app is very useful for those who are unfamiliar with the university campus.', 'Bullshit', 'No rain no pain', 'Very useful.', "This should have more downloads. It's a good app. It has to be used in conjunction with the maps in each building though so you can find the tunnels and passages between buildings that the directions tell you about.", "Should also integrate maps from buildings so we don't need to look at the ones in buildings. Awesome app. Highly recommended for new students as well.", "I live all the way in CLV n it doesn't give the option of starting there. If this includes CLV this is 5 stars for sure.", 'Very useful and does what it says. But it needs a UI upgrade. And the popup blocks the map. Please fix that.', 'This is exactly what I was looking for at this very moment', "Doesn't include new buildings like the STC", 'Needs more options', 'Good job to whoever created this.', "This has a very thorough and complete listing of the tunnels, even the ones not known by most people. It's nice to see this collected in such a nice package. However, the recommended routes are not always ideal. They sometimes omit the use of tunnels when they may lengthen the route, but given that the priority is to avoid going outside I'd like to see the use of indoor tunnels as the priority. Still a good effort, though, and I hope to use it frequently.", 'Tried to find directions between two buildings I visit regularly and the app gives a detailed and accurate indoor route. Also useful for winter when temperature is -20 degrees.', 'I like the map', 'This app solves a big problem in winter.  Full disclosure: I contributed some code to this project.', "No matter what I do it doesn't let me download it", 'Now the amount you want to be outside is adjustable!
