Not your node, not your bitcoin).

Hopefully this will be rectified soon.', 'Works over TOR to manage a remote node.', "Great Bitcoin Lightning Network wallet application that you 'pair' with your Lightning Node. This one is particularly useful because it has REST Tor support and allows you to easily pair it back with a LN node back home etc. Note this one does not have a self contained Lightning node, you need to set that up separately. As I write this review, it's one of the few (if only?) Android Lightning Network wallet apps that support connecting through tor.", "The ui makes it really obvious its cross platform, but thats not a big deal. mostly it doesnt seem to work. it says it's connected to my node but it doesmt dosplay anything.", 'This is the app you want when you want to control your remote Lightning Network node on the go.
