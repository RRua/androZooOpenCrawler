Being able to translate the data into graphs is so useful and the widget feature is really great to be able to access my tracks and graphs easily. The app is free with no ads which a refreshing bonus. Really impressed.", 'Simple and easy interface. Exactly what I was looking for! Nice to not have any third party service involved, yet can easily export and backup as needed.', 'Confusing and when I figured it out failed to give me the graph I wanted (bar graph) the line graph would have worked but something was wrong there as well. And made no sense.', 'Edit: all problems disappeared after last update. Thank you.', 'This is just a fantastic app for graphing. I use it daily to chart my Pension and ISA values. So much easier than making entries in a spreadsheet. It easy to use, well documented, flexible and allows an export to csv file I reported a very minor bug and the Dev fixed it within a day - thank you. The five stars are well justified.', 'Does what it supposed to do. It has a very clean privacy policy, and it has no ads or trackers. And it is all summarized by the fact that it available on F-Droid as well. Kudos to the developer. Hopefully, we get the feature to place widgets on the home screen in future.', 'This app looks like itll do exactly what I want, however, when I try to make a graph it immediately gets an error and says "invalid line graph set detected" and with one input section just a white uneditable rectangle that pops up then does nothing. I havent even been able to test if the app will properly work yet. If this is fixed and it does what\'s in the previews I\'ll definitely change my rating.', 'There should be fine kind of backup option (specially cloud backup on Nextcloud).', 'Great app! Can handle decimals and multiple lines in graphs.', 'Please add option for entering time duration. I want to track how long I can plank', "Great app, which I'm using to track and graph health related measures, like heart rate and blood pressure. It would be nice to have a color wheel and HEX input instead of just a few colors to select from, for the graphs lines.", 'Minimal app. Does what it says, allows you to keep a log of your choice and create graphs if needed. Ability to export to csv is good thinking. Feature suggestions: 1. Daily export to csv automatically 2. Streak calender / Heatmap', 'This app is amazing if you are interested in having as much control as possible over what you want to track in your life!', 'Did not ask for value.
