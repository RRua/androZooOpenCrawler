Honestly this app is laughable. You would think a 10 yr old with no skills built this app. And to think it is affiliated with a multi billion brand like BT is beyond belief. Nothing works. Interface is terrible. Does not connect to wifi spots, shows a tick button for log off? You try to untick it, the app closes?? Wierd. You need access to the internet to find a hot spot??? Shocking. Google you allowed this app on the app store? Really google? Wow!', 'If like me you own a Fon router to obtain membership to the Fon network it would appear that you are no longer able to connect to BT wifi with Fon hotspots and as most of the Fon hotspots on the map are BT it makes the whole concept pretty useless, used to be great but now almost a pointless app and network.', "Tells me Connected to Fon but doesn't log me in. Background service is running. Auto Connect is checked.", 'It actually displays some of the hotspots. It would be ok if it actually connected in the way it used to a few years ago.', 'No longer automatically connects to BTWifi-with-FON hospots, so basically useless.

Why police is not behind this people and arrest them for \nyeaaaaaars just because of the intention of scam people? I dont get it , \nthis world is full of this and still and it will cus no one cares.... sad', 'Earlier versions used to automatically login.

Thieving bastards!', 'No  signal, poor signal. always connect broken, need sing in again. cost more 50% money than local internet provider. weste money, waste time.', "doesn't work. It used to work fine, but now it crashes before you put in your password. Useless. Shame, it was good before they messed it up.", "Version 3.5.0 worked well.  3.5.1 broken again. Previous versions haven't worked properly for a while.  Seems to do a better job in Portugal and Spain.", "I use to love this app.  But now I'm not sure.

Why?', 'Latest version works well and connects quickly.', "The app works fine, and the fact that it logs you in automatically when you connect to a hotspot is very convenient. There's one issue though: what's the use of an app which requires internet to tell you where you can find internet when you don't have it?!
