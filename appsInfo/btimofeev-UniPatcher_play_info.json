I have checked permissions and read/write access is allowed. This app USED to work a few years ago. What happened?', "5 stars hands down! This is much more fluid and stable-looking than another patcher I tried. Also, if anyone is having problems, consider that your original ROM file may be at fault. I have a SMW rom that I've played perfectly fine for years, but no matter what I tried I could not get the patch to work with it. I tried downloading a different ROM of the same game and it combines with the patch perfectly.", "Couldn't patch the rom and then spent a couple minutes finding a different rom, only for that not to work either. Ended up downloading the patcher that I had on my old phone and it patched just fine. Only giving 2 stars and not 1 because it works for some people.", 'wowww thank you for making this app. I am playing a game called saiyuuki world nintendo game and I needed the app to patch the Japanese language in english. I have succeeded. I have played the game in my childhood in Japanese language and now i am able to play the game in english at my android phone because of you. thanks again.', "It's not good I entered the ROM and selected an application I wanted to patch but it didn't work. That is why I gave it one star . I will advise you to change it. And I advise people not to download it because it is not good.", "This patcher is great. However, I would love to have support for xDelta 1 patches. I can't find anything for android that can patch them, leaving me with patches that I can't apply to my roms.", 'After trying 5 different ROMs I finally got it Maybe the version history on the other 4 was outdated. Worked like a charm, plays beautifully. Guess it really it just the ROM and the user, not the app', "I'm not sure if it was user error... Yeah... I tried patching super Mario Land, (with the DX patch) I have no idea if it was my fault... But it just simply blanked the entire ROM 😶", "Tried patching Final Fantasy Tactics on my PSP emulator. Tried it 10 different ways and it wouldn't work. Once I get that I'll give 5 stars.", '4 stars because its an awsome app, and has worked countless times, It would be 5 stars if the developer(s) added .xdelta support', 'The app was great at first but when i tried to patch super mario 64 ds it said i needed an external program. And everytime i try to patch thr rom it says error Edit: i have no idea how to use ZArcheiver. Thats all', "The perfect patching app! Sometimes I use the wrong ROM. Plus, you're also able to change the name of it!", 'App worked great. Only complaint is that I cant use roms/Patches that are saved on my sd card', "Haven't been able to get a single rom and translation to patch. I have tried multiple roms as suggested, still...nothing. I am almost certainly going to uninstall this app if I cannot receieve actual help soon.", 'Works flawlessly for me, the donate button is a little annoying, but I completely get it.', "It's working perfectly for patching my psp game on the phone. Feeling unsure at first because of the rating was below 4 stars it needs to be higher because the app deserve it. Pro tip: pls just read the instructions to use it before rating it lower", "The one and only patcher on android and it do what it's described... don't know why people give 1 star... only noob give 1 star because they don't know how to use this patcher", "Nice and very easy to use, I was able to play a ROM hack of Super Mario 64 called Waluigi's Taco Stand.", 'This app just won\'t let me play patched games on my Wii emulators Snes9x GX, vba GX etc. "Error loading game!". Spent over a week patching 😑. Patching from pc works fine. Used Unipatcher so I wouldn\'t have to spend time in front of a pc patching. I\'m not gonna give negative reviews based on that, but man, that sucked. 😕 Patching with the other Android "Rom Patcher" works just fine. Checksum errors aplenty. Happy extracting ALL of your patched roms and fixing every single checksum.', 'No matter what version of a rom I would use, the software would refuse to patch it. I tried every known version of the game I was trying to patch but no version worked, even the version recommended by the patch creators.', 'Patches games just like I need and without even leaving my phone. Love that I can have both the rom and patch from my cloud storage and not have to use my pc to patch for a romhack as a middleman.', 'Liked it,but i have a problem,you see,whenever i try to do a patch with a bps file,it says error and that the rom is not compatible with the patch,but the patch is based on the game,no matter how many times i try it,it says the same freaking thing,PLEASE help', "Don't usually take the time to review an app, but after spending the better part of an hour trying to figure out how to remove a header from an SNES rom on my phone so I could patch the damn thing, eventually stumbled upon this app and it took care of everything. So happy to have found it.", 'Writing this not only for a great app, but to counter the hopeless idiot that left a 1 star review saying "I dont know how to use this. Might change my rating if the creator tells me how to use this." Please dont get frustrated that this app "isnt working" and leave a 1star review. This app was used for my first ever patch of a rom. It is incredibly user friendly and intuitive. Patching is done fast. Great app', "This app doesn't EVER patch the files. No matter what format I try it says they are incompatible when I've seen others put the exact same patch and file together. A seriously crappy thing that isn't very effective.", "Oof, i realized what they ment of console patcher, well it doesn't hurts to try on Android games, certainly it did work on some console games so i will rate this 4 starts.", "Nice app but it is so hard to get the right rom so i don't get an error. For mario world hacks i have tried the different regions of the game and made sure they were clean roms but i still get the rom is not compatible error. Edit: I got a sfc rom and it worked fine.", "It's great! Easy to use, and fun for rom hacks, but my only complaint is that it kinda does n64, like sm64, when I use a patch with it it only goes past the title screen. But the app is still great.", "Hey developer, I need some help with this, it keeps saying unknown patch format? I don't understand, and now it's saying the ROM isn't compatible?", "Doesn't work. Tried to patch several times using different rooms and patches. Just to patch SMW", 'When I try to use a translator for dragon quest 5 and the rom. It says its not compatible with the rom.', "No notifications, so I can't check the patching progress. I'm on android 10.", 'Works great for me. Remember, if you have issues patching a ROM, check to see if you have the right patch or ROM file.', 'A nice little app, it does what its supposed to do, It has a easy to understand interface and its very useful.', 'Patched a PSX bin file using a mod I found online. Worked like a charm. Thanks dude !', 'Works perfectly with my ROMs, best patcher for mobile!', "It's awesome! This deserves 5 stars all around!! It's super convenient and easy to use, very simple, and just overall a great app! Thank you!", 'Wow finally I can play one of my favorite game Fullmetal Alchemist GBA in English. Thanks both to the patch translator, and to this app of course 😁', "Well I can't just patch some of my games. Why does the app have to be for old fashioned games. 😡😡😡", 'Brilliant app. Does exactly what you need too. Great to be able to play Rom hacks without having to get to a PC to patch a Rom.'], 'appId': 'org.emunix.unipatcher', 'url': 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.emunix.unipatcher&hl=en&gl=us'}
