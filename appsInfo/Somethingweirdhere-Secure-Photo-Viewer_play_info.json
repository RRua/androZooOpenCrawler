Would've been nice if it supported pdfs and more video file types.", 'Amazing application. I have been looking for an app like this since forever. Works flawlessly. Thanks to the developer for making this app. You did a really good job. Some people are stupid giving this app just 1 or 2 star.', 'A little slow to come up after locking but other than that EPIC!', 'Had scenarios where I did not want it playing media on lock screen. And from day 1, wished it would just go straight to loading the media‚Ä¶', 'I love the functionality and simplicity of this app. Wish I could give it 6 stars.', 'i love the functionality and simplicity of this app. wish i could give it 4stars‚ú®', 'Thank You, Works Like a Charm !!!', 'Perfect app to keep nosy people away from my pictures. 10/5 stars!', 'Very Useful app', 'Great app serves its porpouse. 10 stars', "Exactly what I've been looking for long time!", 'Works as advertised.', 'Exactly what I needed', 'Very important to me', 'it does what it says', 'this is nkt even an app i can open', 'Brilliant.', "Galaxy note 3. Simple and effective. Been searching a long time for an app to do exactly what this app does. Works smoothly and flawlessly. It's worth noting, there are no icons on the home screen or anywhere else. To use this app follow the 2 pictures on the app page,  1. Have pass word lock on phone. 2. install app. 3. Open any photo gallery 4. Select photos to view 5. Click share to 6. Select secure photo viewer 7. screen blacks out for a moment 8. Photos appear. 9. Finished viewing, unlock phone ,üòÄ", "Great app, love the concept... Has one small flaw... If the user is using smart Lock like I am and one of the conditions is met  (e.g. at home) then the lockscreen isn't really stopping anyone... So please have the app lockdown the lockscreen before showing the photos", "Good idea and well implemented for the limitations in place with OS. As other reviews said, it won't override any features that keeps your device unlocked, such as Trusted Devices, etc. But it does create a limited experience of just the media I meant to share, and at least requires exiting that experience and swiping up to open my phone for real, which is an acceptable and welcome barrier vs none at all, albeit easy to overcome.", 'I have been waiting for this app! I want to show people pics of my son without them accidentally seeing pics of his birth. My thanks to the developer! :)', "Thanks Dev, this masterpiece works like a charm!, it's convenient and easy to use. If you can't figure out how it works, please read the instructions (RTFM!)", 'Very good job. A way to automatically do it would be perfect but is good enough. You can show pictures while not having to worry with the rest of the content.', "Just heard from XDA and installed it from play store. It's an awesome app. The dev whose idea behind it, is a genius.

Excellent app, allows you peace of mind when handing over your phone to show photos.', 'Does not work waste of space', 'I hate to give 2 stars but I do have a lock on my but seems the app is not working.   Yes i have a lock screen and yes  I have uninstall and reinstall the app. I tap the picture, then share, then tap the app after I tap the app the nxt menu states to lock the device or pin  this app then TAP HERE.( With a wide gap)  Tap where? The only thing in the bottom is view. Pls help.', 'Very nice! No more stress about someone scrolling here and there.', 'Works well! Pictures appear shortly after locking screen, back button and home button go to lock screen.', 'It\'s not a gallery, so make sure you read the "how to use" in the \ndescription. It works well!', "No idea how to use even doesn't locate this app where is it on my device after installed.", "App doesn't downloaded", 'Excellent app! Just surprised no one thought of this before.
