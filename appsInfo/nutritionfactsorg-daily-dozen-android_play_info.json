Really helps me focus on eating more whole foods rather than less processed foods. It great to have so many videos available for us to watch and learn more. For example I had no idea that coconut milk has quite a bit of saturated fat, and had been using it often. I'd definitely be interested to read Dr. Greger's book.", "This app has really helped me to get into eating a healthier diet, as I can just check off what I'm eating throughout the day. It's been hard adjusting, but after about a week I finally did my first true Daily Dozen day where I ate it all, and I'm hoping that I can start to make that a regular and common thing. Overall if you care about your health then this is a great app for you.", 'I really like this app. It is keeping my attention on my goal of whole, perfect, thin healthy, and strong body all day long. DR Greger is one of my life heroes. Thank you for all that you do. I read both of your books. It would be nice if there was a place in this app to make personal observations and daily notes of struggles, and improvements. Thank you.', "I truly think that this app is changing my life. I'm a newbie (3 weeks in), I can see visible changes in my waist line and sleep patterns. Also I spend about 1/3 of what I used to spend on groceries, but eat far more actual food. Noticed a big difference in my allergies so far this year as compared to last year's. Johnnie 55 contractor very active with an athletic build.", "I've only just started using this app (3 days now) but I am very much enjoying it! I love that I can tap any of the food serving groups to be reminded what a serving size is. I actually haven't always been able to finish all of the servings as it is a lot of food! I am down about 2.5 lbs too! This is by far the easiest diet/food tracking app I've ever used and as someone who's working to overcome 22 years of eating disorders I like that I don't need to track calories (trigger for me)!", "I have been using this app off and on for maybe a year now just to have a general idea of what i should be eating in a day, but for the past 2 weeks I've been strict about my portions and it's just so much food. I actually put on weight (which is a good thing) and I feel full and satisfied throughout the day. A well deserved five stars", 'A very good "daily-friend" to remind you to make the right choices for yourself. I\'m building the habit of first checking the app before preparing a meal, so I know exactly what my next meal should include. I\'m only giving 4* because I couldn\'t really find out if these daily dosages are apllicable to everyone or how they should be adapted from person to person.', 'BEST APP EVER! I am so appreciative of the makers of this app. My brother recently introduced me to the plant based lifestyle and specifically the "How not to Die" book, written by Dr. Greger. This app is the perfect complement to that book. My favorite part is that the app tracks how many days you have been on a streak of eating the right foods. Way to go! Keep spreading the whole food plant based life!!! Thank you!!!', 'I like that the interface is clean and there are no ads. It\'s really easy to track the daily dozen. My only complaint is that so much of the content is focused on losing weight, especially the "21 Tweaks". How about some tips for someone looking to gain weight.', "Really great app, but especially for anyone who has read Dr Greger's book 'How not to die'. I don't always achieve the full quota, but filling in the app keeps me focused.", "Very useful app. It encourages me to eat healthy and exercise everyday. It's really useful for new vegans and for people wanting to follow a healthy diet but don't know where to start.", "As someone who grew up before the IT age, I'm not into apps but this was the exception. Very easy to use, it provides heaps of information and has a very clear screen. I love this app, which exceeded my expectations.", 'Amazingly useful and well designed app. It is rare to find both an organization that is as helpful as nutrition facts, and an app that is as functional and well designed as this one. Everyone who worked on this app and for nutrition facts should be proud.', "Wow ! What a great app to implement everything that I learned in Doctor Gregor's book How Not to Die and How Not to diet ! Never felt healthier in my life while eating tons of amazing tasting foods!", "L-O-V-E Dr.Greger's Daily Dozen App! Makes me so aware of what I choose to eat, and drives me to think of ways to enrich my meals! Reading HOW NOT TO DIE book + using this app definitely upgraded my approach and appreciation towards nutrition and health!", "Love this simple way to remind myself to eat a complete and balanced diet. When I am hungry for a snack, it's so helpful to peek at this app and see what foods will round out my day.", 'My 10 year old Son who has mild autism and I have been using this app together to track our whole food eating. He loves the ticking and tracking boxes, has even kept me honest :) But the difference in our day to day lives from actually following through with (almost) all the recommendations has become really noticeable over time. Game changer.... you owe it to yourself to follow through on this program and see where you end up.', "Even though I'm not strictly plant-based, I find the daily dozen app helpful in setting healthy eating goals and tracking my progress. It's easy to use and I like the graphs it provides.", 'I love the daily dozen app. However, I just finished reading "How Not to Diet", and learned that the app has another page called 21 Tweaks. I have only been able to bring up 21 Tweaks page a few times. Mostly the app won\'t change from daily dozen to tweaks. I am using a Samsung android phone. Can someone help me with getting the app to switch back and forth between pages?', 'Love that it is easy to use as you check off your food items. Helps you reach the Daily Dozen by showing you the missing food choices. Builds your confidence that your meals are healthy.', 'The app is easy to use for basic tracking and offers free access to nm informative videos about nutrition and health. Thank you Dr. Gregor for your generosity and knowledge.', 'Amazing way to ensure you eat a delicious and balanced diet! Super easy to use and track intake. Explains what amounts and types of foods to eat with easy videos and added information. It\'s a must have app and diet for anyone that\'s concerned about their health! I highly recommend the "How Not To Die" cookbook too.', 'This app is helping me eat healthy while staying home during the pandemic. Instead of reaching for junk food, I check this app to see other food choices to meet the daily dozen challenge.', 'This app makes it so easy to remember to eat healthy to have a long and happy life. Following the guidelines has dramatically improved the health of my family!', "This is a great eating plan for good health! A great user interface and a way to help implement the information in Dr. Greger's books.", "Brilliant little app that's so simple to use. It works so well and is an amazing tool in helping you hit those important Plant Based goals of your 'Daily Dozen.'", 'Love this app! It is so easy to follow with amazing, useful information. So easy to eat very healthy with this app as a guide.', 'Easy to use and I use it everyday. This is no diet, just a lifestyle for great health. Listen to Dr Greger and look after yourself.', "I'm obsessed with this app. I love how I can ensure I'm getting everything I need in my diet while learning all about the latest science behind the benefits of certain foods/food groups. This app is truly empowering, has no ads and is set up so well!", 'Love app! I found that it also helps me stay within the point limits on Weight Watchers! And eases my 6 month practice of whole foods plant based way of earning!', 'Love it. Easy to use and great info in the video links. Just need to buy your cook book now', 'Love this app! I used to think that I ate healthily,... But this app has helped me really eat healthy. I feel better than I have in quite some time!', 'Great app!!! I only wish that I could add my own recipes or food combinations.', 'Wonderful to keep track of what I am eating. Nice to see the best foods in each category. Awesome app. Great to see someone trying to improve the health of others.', "Helped me get into a routine of drinking more water, and choosing healthier options everytime I'm hungry.", 'Amazing info. Very encouraging. Helps adopt and track small yet impactful changes to diet and lifestyle. Thank you.', 'Helped us moving away from junk food vegan to more whole foods plant based. Cut out oil, processed stuff, focused on eating from each food groups and followed the 21 tweaks, lost about 10 lbs in a month, feeling and eating better than before. Great inspo to eat better. Absolutely love it!', 'I like this app, because it helped me to form healthy habits!! :)', 'Really a great app. Focused on health. Helps me with weightloss and no gimmicks. Easy and not intrusive.', 'I feel great using this app. I introduced a hypertensive diabetic aquaintence in the lake victoria area in Tanzania. She got cured in four weeks using this app. In 1998 I cured my mother of her diabetes in six weeks using a crude type of daily dozen. My nephew was scheduled for hip sockets replacement. He used this daily dozen and was told there was no need of surgery. A lady was scheduled for a knee replacement surgery. She had no Tsh 10 milion for the surgery. She nolonger has pains.'], 'appId': 'org.nutritionfacts.dailydozen', 'url': 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.nutritionfacts.dailydozen&hl=en&gl=us'}
