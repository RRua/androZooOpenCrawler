All the others missed on one or more points (some don't provide for encrypted text; some actually place transferred files on servers with URLs; some require account on author's servers and some require being logged into those servers to function correctly.)  Rough edges but given the above, well worth working with cmeng to smooth them out!  I recommend this XMPP client, but none of the others due to their serious functional deficiencies!", "Thank you for making this great app. Among all the apps that I've tested this has got the greatest coverage for XMPP protocol. One request. I hope that devs can add support for a news feed feature where the app users can create publically acessible posts. Like movim. The app already supports xep-0060 & xep-00163. Adding this functionality will transfrom the app from an IM client to a full blown social network. Highly impressed with the efforts of atalk team. Keep up the good work.", 'This program is wonderful but it needs more improvement for video calls and camera setting in vertical mode,the connection between this program and other xmpp programs like jitsi desktop is perfect, i hope you improve this program in next versions,thank u so much👍👍👍', 'Great app for getting jabber notifications and real time messaging!
