Since the latest pixel update I lost the simple ability to 1 click share to clipboard. This brings back a feature I use at least 20 times a day on my work phone. You have saved me a significant number of needless clicks each day. Simple interface, set and forget. Absolutely perfect.', "Works great for apps that don't have proper sharing.", 'This just uploads the image to google photos and gives you a link. There is nothing new or fancy going on here. I want to be able to actually copy an image to my clipboard on native android. Samsungs can do it, but the pixel and essential PH-1 cannot.', 'It notifies audibly, and puts up a notification that disappears before it can be used. /But I do want to use the notification; I cannot, because it lasts only a second./30 seconds would be enough.', 'Works!! No idea why this previously standard function was removed from android Q on my s10. Maybe it was just Samsung trying to add its own "features" to Android?', 'Works as intended.
