I mistakenly selected the wrong region for my phone and installed the wrong update. I contacted support, they showed me the steps to get me back to the correct region everything was back to working condition. The app its self is easy-to-use (just don't select the incorrect region like me...) Updates come quick and install without any issues.", "Unable to update (root) I have a rooted OnePlus 7. I downloaded the update and selected all install options like backup device, keep root (selected magisk as root package) and when I click install update it just booted into TWRP. That's it. No installation, no scripts running. Just TWRP homescreen. I booted back into the ROM. Looks like it doesn't work. I've given all permissions to this app. Including root. So developers, have you even tested this app on rooted OOS phone?", "I see update available for One Plus 5T on this application. I checked their official website for the same. I do not find any such update. Just wanted to ensure is it released or not. I don't want to lose the data on the mobile. I even checked updates using VPN but no such rollout for Android Q. No word on One plus community app as well.", "I rated 1 star because you said version 4.0 has this option, yet you kept this option hidden for when a download fails. I don't want to waste those data on failed download. I will use another app to download that handles slow network and interrupted download well. The only reason i installed this app is because of the download link. If I have to hunt that down, then I may as well do that from the web. No need for this app. Update: it doesn't show link if i disconnect internet. 1 star stays..", "OnePlus should be paying you for actually pushing out their updates in a timely manner. It's been almost a month since the last update was released and my phone still hadn't gotten it, luckily this was an option. I was against having to install a 3rd-party app just to do something that the phone itself should already do but I guess that's what you have to do on an OnePlus phone. Thank you.", "This app has provided an easier way to update the software no matter you're on beta cycle or the general one. In my case I can't wait for OnePlus to push the update so I come to this app. OnePlus related news is a nice addition to the app. Since, I am a big fan of dark mode, it has covered that too.", "I saw in the app that stable version of Oxygen OS 10.3.3.HD65AA was available for OnePlus 7T so I downloaded and installed it on my OnePlus 7T but I just had a concern that This will not effect my phone's software because it is not showing the changelog. Kindly please clear my concern. One more concern that the may update is still to be roll out in my phone so it would update again or nothing will happen?", "OK I don't understand one thing, Let's say I have upgraded to beta 14 and now that ws removed I can't downgrade to 13 because downgrade is not allowed, Here is the thing what is the point removing the broken update to people who have installed and confuse them with beta 13 as fix when they can't downgrade it waste of storage space, I guess? Maybe just don't show that info to users so they don't download something they don't need or can't install or at least let them know before downloading..", "Giving 5 star as this app has never failed me. But I dont know why this time it is the other way. Oneplus has rolled 10.3.3 for oneplus 6t a day or two before but why the update hasn't yet been made available on the app or is it? Edit:- The update is available in the app right now. But why the size of update is 1.87 GB. Shouldn't it be an incremental update file only of some MB's. Why I need to download the whole file.", "Fails EVERY SINGLE TIME. I have never been able to actually finish a download using this app. It's just a glorified notification that I need to search the internet for the file. Maybe add a download manager so you can pick up downloading where it failed?", "Persistent notification saying Oxygen Updater is running in the background. I don't want it to run in the background, but there's no obvious/clean way to stop it. Uninstalling until I want to update again.", 'Worst your app is unofficial, because from when I updated my oneplus 7t updates 10.3.2 after updating my phone is getting heated while charging. Worst app ever since temperature during charing is 45 degree. While charging your handset pres *#800# you will get the entire details. I contacted to customer care in Banglore they said visit service center they will degrade your software after that they will flash your handset and then they will officially update to 10.3. 2 version very bad', 'I can\'t download the update version, in my phone there is come a Notification form this app and that is -" you **** update is available now, Please download this system on your device(Op 7T)", but when i go to this app, i can\'t not find any update, if i can\'t any update how can i will download update system on my device.', "This thing works so great.

I have just downloaded it but not installed it...i am waitin', 'Great app, works really well! Easy to detect and download the applicable update and installation instructions are easy to follow. Thanks dev!', 'Love getting updates faster. The only fault I find is updates being labeled oddly example beta 5 on site, beta 34 on device. Please make labels consistent. If the update is for several devices, just list them, or make the cross reference available. Keep up the great work', 'Qxygen updater is very helpful application with latest notification oneplus news, updates for oxygen os very quick services before update application was great but after updating new version i had notice application has annoying ads coming in between while updating please fix it overall, its safe. Thanks!', "Used to be a great app. But since the last few updates it's useless. Never picks up new updates. I have to use official updater. The update log shows previous update and wrong update 10.3.2 February. I'm in 10.0 .0.8 with McLaren 7T Pro EU. So should show 10.0.8 March update.", "Was a bit sceptical at first but then I have the app a chance and well it worked really well, very simple to use and thanks to then I've got the update faster than usual.", 'Excellent UI, but I find the blur effect at the top and bottom unnecessary and distracting. Other than that everything else is perfect: updates download lightning quick and the app notifies you instantly.', 'Seems some issue with latest version..I am unable to see the stable build 10.3.3 after the official announcement of stable build by OnePlus. On my 6T even after 12 hours of stable release updater is showing the last stable version 10.3.2 only..seems like updater is not working properly.', 'Great app. Even greater (and very fast) support! Solved my problem in less than 15 minutes via email.', 'Only missing item is if we update using this app, update log is missing. Except that everything is perfect. Try to get update log too.', "I don't normally get such apps installed, but what the hell, tried it anyways. Expectations have been met ♥️ Got the update the very next day after the latest OnePlus 6T update was announced. Had to pause the download mid-way, but was able to resume download without any problem after an hour.", 'Beat the queue, and receive official OTAs by directly downloading them at your convenience. One of the very few highly trusted and usable app. The app was previously managed by another very capable developer and now its passed on to even better hands. Thanks Adhiraj!', 'Very smooth flowing. I have no issues after installing Android 10. OnePlus 5T still responds as fast as it did before the update.', "Bravo ! I justnow installed app and did manual update for my oneplus 7t indian version..Guess what it's worked..Thanks a lot developer ! Thank for giving me feedback of my question... I highly advice all oneplus mobile user to install this app.. A must have app for all oneplus mobile owner... Best devlopers i have seen after long time... Good response from devloper...", 'Great app, my OnePlus 7 pro was stuck on January 2020 security patch. I will be using this app again as OnePlus is becoming like all the other manufacturer with slow updates.', 'This app is very good Thus app gives you the latest OnePlus news and you get the latest OnePlus system updates before anyone else (which had been the cayfor the last 2 updates). I highly recommend this app.', "There's only one thing that bugs me... Some logos are really low res, that's could be fixed easily... Other than that, love it. Update - it's fixed!", 'Wonderful way to update my device. I wish there was a paid version without ads. Edit: thank you for the reply. I have removed the ads. Enjoy the coffee.', 'Brilliant piece of software, does nothing more than its function, ad-free and simple and effective.', "So redesign of app is why phone said it wasn't installed but clearly it was. Great update devs keep up the hard work and stay safe! I've used this app twice as intended in the 6 month I've downloaded it.", "The ads are awful, as many are full screen and have audio. Definitely worth paying the $1 to remove. Otherwise it's a great app!", "Would've given it 5 stars, but it constantly runs in the background and I can't cope with it, gotta always go to the settings and force stop it. Please reach out", 'Great app, always has the newest update and works with no problem. No boring ads or spam notifications. A warm recommendation for all OnePlus users', 'Just updated my 8 pro with this app and so far everything is great working fine no problems. I hope everything stays OK but for now I am well pleased.
