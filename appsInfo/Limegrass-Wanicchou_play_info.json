But still, it\'s amazing! keep up the good work!', "What an awesome resource for an intermediate Japanese language learner like me! I found this app thanks to Tofugu and I feel like it broadened my horizons immediately. So far, I've just used it to look up words I know (such as çŠ¬) but reading the definition for such an easy word is great practice and also a window into the world of thinking in Japanese, which is a huge goal for me right now. The only problem with this app is that the arrow button in the lower right always crashes the app.", "Really nice app! Surprised there aren't more J-J dictionaries with ankidroid support!
