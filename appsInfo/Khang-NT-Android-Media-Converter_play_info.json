Wanted to convey this to the developer privately, but his published gmail account bounced. Hey dev! You there? Update: tried again mts. Still fails immediately. Another note to dev: it would be really helpful if one can "share" / send to this app to setup a new job', 'A speedy converter, very capable of handling a batch conversion (no lags, no freeze/crash, no problems) and fairly easy to use. No complaints from me! Since this app is in development, what I want to suggest is probably already in your plans any way..it is a feature to merge audio and video files. Thank you and keep up the good work.', "Works every time without fail, and no ads (not that I've noticed, anyway). A good feature to add would be to sort files by date added, as a lot of ones that I convert have non-descript names, so I need to go to my file browser to see what they're called before selecting them in the app.", 'This app is really great to batch convert audio files! Suggestion: it could be useful to be able to sort files by extensions when selecting the audio files to be converted.', "Absolutely the best in its class. Simple interface, excellent compatibility with virtually all forms of audio files, and it's QUICK!", 'I was frying to convert an 1 hour long wav file to mp3, I have tried several other converters and they took around 10 mins, where this app did it around 5 mins, so very fast I would say.', "It's my first time downloading the App and it just works great. I tested it & convertered M4A to MP3, Mov to Mp4, extracted Audio from MP4 to convert to MP3. No Ads, and the file conversion was actually fast. I didn't encountered any problems at all & also had no issues locating files on my sd card. I would definately recommend A+", 'Omg. this app is cool. My songs were converted to nakw format and since then, I have been looking for a way to convert them to mp3 format. this app did it all at once. God bless the app creators🙏', 'I give it a four star because it only lacks a search button, but its perfect and faster in converting files. I recommend it the best app to convert', 'Amazing Converter I use just about for all my mp3 and i really like noise reduction at from start to end. Jump right into the song no waitting for long periods.', 'This is perfect! A simple converter, and has the needed formats! I also love how the trim silence works, thank you developers for this app!', "Absolutely the most great app for media converting so far. Good job and don't forget to apply dark mode in the upcoming update. Amazing!", 'Tried converting a video with DTS audio. Failed codec not found. (File played with in device). Im not a techno guy. So i felt it was needed Apart from that seems ok', "Fast and easy to use. However, I couldn't find a way to extract video without its audio.", 'I had some video files I desperately needed in a different format. Nothing I could find, not video player, editor, or converter app could view or even open these files, except Media Converter Pro! From this app I can put my videos in a format that will work with anything!

I have come across some files that cannot be converted though, and the error message wasn't to clear.", 'Awesome app! Better than any of the paid ones and no ads! Saved me a lot of time transferring to PC for conversion. Recommended for anyone who needs to convert or recompress audio files. Good work! Well done!', 'Beware... This application rapidly alters certain files and modifies the file structure of the device and/or external data storage media without asking the user!', 'Super quick and easy video conversion. It just does the job with no fuss.', "Fails on MOV to MP4. My Canon camera records in MOV. when transferred to my S10, Gallery does not see them. I figured i'd use this app. After going through the pain of selecting all the MOVs, and going through the App's odd interface, I'd be fine.... nope! after selecting 11 MOV files it blipped as complete, which is impossible. basically it said nothing other than complete. you can't convert eleven 60MB files in 100msecs on a phone. So this does not work!!!", 'So far it is great. I am using it to convert m4a clips recorded by Voice Recorder into mp3 files. I like that the app remembers the folder I select to move the new mp3s to so that I do not need to find that file every time. I have only figured out how to begin conversion of one file at a time, but you can command it to do new conversions while it is still processing the last conversion commands.', "Best app on the market for file conversion. Being able to queue up a whole list of conversions is what makes this one stand out. It's a no brainer that every single app of this kind should have. It is very strange to me that it has taken until 2019 for an app this user friendly to appear on the app store, and it is completely free with absolutely 0 ridiculous permissions requests.", "amazing :) but there is a bug and a question, bug: when I've completed a Wizard for some files and some of those files are still in progress meanwhile i finish another Wizard for other files with different destination folder, last in quene files also goes to the new destination and new checklist gets completely ignored. question: is high quality 220-260 better than high speed 320? (also suggest: preferred converting setting shouldn't reset every time user opens the app)", 'Awesome app. I mostly convert .Avi and other formats to .mp4 so I can watch on My PS4', 'Great job to the developer👍 The best files to convert are the "digital remastered " . I\'ve converted everything from Beethoven - Moonlight Sonata to Iron Maiden - Run to the Hills It\'s like having a brand new music library. Even on my UE-Boom it\'s still is a huge difference in the quality and sound of the music. With a decent size A2 mSDXC card I\'ve had no issues with storage.', "Pretty good awesome app! A few things... Can you make a dark theme? Can the developer let us choose a bunch of .FLAC files at one time and then let us convert them all at once? It kinda takes some time having to go back and pick the next .FLAC file, set up the options again, convert it and then rinse and repeat until you finally get all your FLAC files converted. Ugh! Can you also let us pick the 320kbs (max) setting for the produced .mp3 file from the .FLAC? And how about adding more audio formats to convert .FLAC into, like... .m4a, .wav, .aiff, etc? Do this and you will get 5 stars and a donation for some beer, coffee or wax! One more thing, can you have it remember the directories that we choose for the file to be converted and for the save location. I'm having to go back and choose each location for every new file I convert and I'm not even leaving the app. Thanks Dev!", 'Gets the job done. Minus 1 star due to UX, the ui is a bit clunky and rudimentary. However, works like a charm. Used to have to do this on a desktop computer, no more thanks to Media Converter Pro! 5 stars if it was a bit easier to use, like selecting an entire folder to convert, setting output defaults, select all option and so on.', 'Im glad i didnt pay for this one. Works at a snales pace and one file at a time. Wont convert about 95% of the Flv and Wmv files i have. Gives error message.', 'Wow really fast & actually works! First time I set up 4 files (flac to mp3) & based on experience with other apps I expected to wait at least a few minutes on each file so when it said all 4 were done after just a few seconds I was sure it failed because that seemed TOO fast... until I opened them. They not only played perfect start to end, but even kept the album art- every other app I tried lost the art. Finally I can stop searching for a good converter now that I found a great one.', "It's a very brilliant app. It can convert to any music nitrate.", 'Great app. Quickly converts audio to other formats, also converts video to audio. i would love the option to trim videos before converting, and the option to "clear all" finished jobs instead of doing it individually; otherwise the app is fantastic and has a great, smooth user experience. Very pleased with it.', "I've tried converting FLAC and opus source files to ogg/mp3 as individual as well as batch jobs, and it does its job extremely well, and quickly too. It also has a very nice UI. And the cherry on top is that it needs the bare minimum of permissions, and is open source. Big props to the developer! Thank you very much!", "Well, I just converted a gapless album from FLAC to mp3. It converted flawlessly and plays as a gapless album in the mp3 format. I also like how you use the lame library with VBR quality 0 (highest quality). I would do the same thing if I were to use Audacity on my PC to export mp3 files. One complaint, though. If I accidentally tap to select more files instead of going to the job manager, I can't access the job manager until I exit the app and reopen it. Please fix this.", 'So far, so great! Lets you exclude filetypes, full range of options for encoding, easy interface... Another app had no way to specify folders to draw from, meaning I had to scroll through the entire 60gb of music on my device to try to find the files i needed to convert... No such incompetence here. And so far, not an ad in sight! Great job.', 'Very useful, converts to almost anything. One of the best media converter ヽ(・ω・)ノ', "Does exactly what it's expected to do. But it's still in a really early stage - converting a single file is really easy, but converting a folder is painful - it doesn't remember the last used folder, doesn't remember the last encoding settings (and no way to select multiple files in one go)", "So far I am really impressed. I haven't seen any ads, the user interface is pretty straight forward, and the conversion is fast. I haven't used it extensively yet, but so far the biggest problem I have encountered is knowing how to set the output quality to keep from creating an output file that is larger than the input file.", "Update 3/8/19: Now that you can add multiple files this is HANDS DOWN the best FLAC converter in the Play Store!!! I've used MANY audio converters over the years. Mainly for FLAC > mp3. By FAR this one is the best free one in the Play Store! It's super fast. (if you have experience in converters you know most of them are slow as hell!) It converts 10 files in less than a minute! The app couldn't be more user friendly. Takes seconds to learn. The developer REALLY did a fantastic job.", 'It converts? but i can\'t seem to open it in my music. I was converting a FLAC file into an MP3 file so that it would be smaller in my phone, but after it gets converted it becomes a "file" and not a music folder(mp3), my samsung music or any other application can\'t read it??? I just dont understand hahahahah a little help please? I want to be able to download the file as an mp3 audio file when its converted.'], 'appId': 'com.github.khangnt.mcp', 'url': 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.khangnt.mcp&hl=en&gl=us'}
