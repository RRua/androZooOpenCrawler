Not confusing to use. The units on the slide menu on the side has been given emphasis by using text as opposed to using icons. This is perception neutral. Not everybody wants an icon for identification. Text is easier to read and identify plus it's arranged alphabetically in this app", "Must have app: a decent set of units, is easy to use, shows no ads and is even open-sourced. The only thing I'm missing sometimes is fraction conversion: common to decimal and vice versa.", "It's a conversion app. It converts. That's it! Download it However, I almost didn't download it due to in-app purchase. But I did anyway because it's open source. It's confusing to say in-app purchases when in reality it only uses that feature for donations. I can't imagine how many didn't download because of that. I suggest you remove the donation feature and externalize it. Have it on the website. Now you get to be a free app with a donation page. Just my 2 cents.", 'Missing some conversions. If it had those it would be a solid 5. Used the request converstion item under settings for needed items.', 'Useful to have around, gives you access to a ton of conversions and info at all times. Offline too!', 'So far, I find this app to be the best for conversions. Very easy to use, very flexible, and very diverse.', 'I\'ve used many conversion apps over the years because of phone upgrades. This is "THE" best app I\'ve ever used. Quick, simple, smooth operation and "NO DAMN ADS", thank you.', "When conversion needed, it's always 'right now'. This app has not disappointed once. Simple to use, reliable, and, for me, has had all conversion options needed.", 'Very useful app, simple to use and see all conversion units result at a glance.', 'Been using it for a couple of years now; it works really well and has a good interface.', 'Fast and easy. simplicity of the app is awesome.', 'The best conversion app! It looks clean and is simple to use.', 'Wide range of conversions, and add free with donate option only.', 'Clean simple and professional layout. Intuitive and easy to use', 'Simple and very handy app! Wish it included wire gauge and a inbuilt calculator would be handy.', 'Very simple to use, most useful conversions available. No ads, so really deserve a donation. The only improvement would be to allow hiding never used conversions to make it easier to spot the useful ones in the list. But this is just a detail. Tks to dev.', 'Perfect for me. Thanks a lot. No useless "flourish and shouting" as is common nowadays... I would like a possibility to view /save as text the used conversion formulae. Per a pair of units or, better, for all of them...', 'Great app, does just what it says. I rely on this one on an almost daily basis.', 'Just downloaded for my trip to New Zealand. Was watching videos on grocery shopping and this app really helped to put the amounts into perspective!!! Very easy to use and has multiple features. Great job!!', 'Best app if ur working on files or for designing nice User interface easy to work with', 'Great design. Love the double row setup. No moving back and forth. No advertisements. Quick conversions. Great variety of metrics. Deserves no less than 5 stars.', "This is very useful when people express distances in kilometres or metres which mean very little to me. I can instantly convert them to miles, feet and occasionally yards and finally understand what they're talking about. Ditto kilogrammes and pounds.", 'Great app, handy, accurate, easy to use.', 'Very user friendly, a great tool to have', 'Fantastic!!! Also love the dark theme... The only thing I would recommend is maybe a favourites or even been able to long press and re-arrange the order.', 'This is a perfect app. Fast, simple, and easy to use. No fancy interface, just a clean and minimal app. I wish more apps were like this.', 'I use this app frequently at work. Definitely a must have for me. Works flawlessly, never crashes.

And I like the dark theme.', "This app is super helpful, and I use it far more than I thought I would! There is virtually every conversion I've ever needed.", 'Excellent app! It seems like the button to switch the units disappears whenever you scroll. Perhaps a dropdown menu can be used instead of the buttons?', 'Great app. A very versatile unit converter. Thanks to the developer for keeping the app free without ads. Highly recommended.', 'Works great, looks professional, no ads for farming games covering the screen.
