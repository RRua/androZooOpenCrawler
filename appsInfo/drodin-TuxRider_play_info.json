Basicly, this remake is trash :(', 'In this game,penguin should be visible so that control is good just like tux rider in linux desktop.Please improve it.', 'You can get the 3rd person one if you Google tux racer apk and the first link is what you should click', 'I luv this game i used to play in my school computer lab when I Was in childhood', 'Just like in the linux computer.', 'i love this game', 'aushom! game but not popular', "childhood's favorite game ðŸ¤—", 'Worst game i ever played ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜’', 'Very bad game', "A pretty good port of Tux Racer. Would appreciate if on-screen contols were added because the motion controls can be annoying. Also, on devices without the menu or camera key, it's impossible to change the view. Also there's no music during the race (though that's not a super big issue like the first two).

A crash report sent...', 'Accelerometer responses not sensitive enough; acts like it wants to turn but doesn\'t turn. Isn\'t clear when the machine zeros, so it\'s hard to get going fast enough soon enough. Maybe have a calibration page, in which you can see your tux responses in bar charts? Or allow the user to dial up/down the sensitivity? As it is, with a "perfect" run on "bumpy ride", still can\'t complete it fast enough... and yes, the penguin seems slow at first.', 'Does not work.', 'Fantastic port of the Free and Open Source classic on Linux!', "But two of of the races don't work", "I love Tux Racer, always have, but passing this on my Galaxy Note 3 is glitchy.
