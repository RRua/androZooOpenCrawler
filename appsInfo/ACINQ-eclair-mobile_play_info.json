I found a couple of nodes near me using the Acinq network explorer, \nbut the connection doesn't happen :-(", 'The wallet for Bitcoin in future BUT it is only on testnet', 'Life changer!', "Update: the new version seems a lot more efficient and stable. A few regressions that I noticed: - Opening a yalls payment link gives me an error. The starblocks links work.  - When I tap a LN payment link on yalls or starblocks eclair is no longer a suggested option, only the lightning wallet is.   This has me really excited for LN but for the love of all things, be consistent with the units used, it's all over the place!   In some parts of the app the amount is shown in Satoshi, others in mBTC and others yet in Bitcoin, what is this madness?! I think I also saw milliSatoshi somewhere.", "*Doesn't show expiration time of a channel. *Channels and the funds get stuck often. *Opening 10 channels heats up and crashes the device * Not able to buy test coffee,teied many times, transactions stuck or fail. * Now the app doesn't even start anymore.", 'Unnecessary struggle because Blockstream Corp. hijacked the Bitcoin project. Thanks to Bitcoin Cash we don\'t have to "open channels" and whatnot, simply make on-chain payment like Bitcoin intended to be from the start. This is why Bitcoin Cash IS Bitcoin, and LN BCore coin is defenetly not. Good luck all, let the best invetion win!', "*bug report: 'seed is unreadable' on startup.

Also, payment link no longer opens wallet.", 'They claimed to lose the signing keys to allowing them to update the app. This is why you stick with the original Bitcoin (cash)', 'Super job!', 'Tutorial is better', 'Amazingly fast', 'This is pretty amazing! I would just make it *much* more clear you can swipe on the main page... I\'m not sure how, but it was very very not apparent how to open a channel at first. It should have some kind of "nudge" like MacOSX icons in the bottom jumping when they need something.  A Bitcoin symbol should jump from the left side saying "send me some $$$ to spend!" and the right side should have a lightning bolt annoy you to open new channels :)', 'Poor user experience. Took a lot of tries to get it to sync. Maybe underlying electrum server issue but should detect and switch or it becimes useless. Anyway, after finally got a balance then tried channel and to buy coffee. Tx never went thru. Channel closed. Balance vanished again and seem to now be on stuck server again. An experience like this will destroy any hope for LN.', "Love the gui.  I'm not sure if this is the best place for feedback, but I couldn't find another.  1. Can I request a payment from a peer? 2. Can I send an LN payment to a peer who is also running this app? 3. Bug... When sending BTC on chain, I clicked the fee setting button and it changed to Low.  There was no way to change it back to High.  I was able to manually enter a fee.  Looking good so far, and a great way to help people understand how LN will work for day to day buying.", "Looks good. Trying to buy a coffee on starblocks however I can't seem to open a chanel when selecting 'paste a node uri'. The auto connect node gives me an error no route.", "You guys have really done an amazing job but you should really think about opening it up to a mainnet alpha. You can cap the number of users and make sure there is a sign up process so that everyone knows funds can be lost given the experimental nature. I just really think there is nothing like real life bug bounties for software like this. Everyone that's excited about what your team is doing would be happy to potentially burn 100 bucks to make your LN app better.", 'A+. Would be neat to view all transactions associated with a particular channel. Tap a channel to get a drop-down of all previous transactions in that channel.
