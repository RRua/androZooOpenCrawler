And I'll have to uninstall :(", "Used to be great application but not working since many days... Now I've to quit the application. Sad to tell that I've left being beta tester too.", 'Sorry, but, it won\'t even let me try to sync. I get this message when trying to log in....

It was 5 out of 5 last year, however i don'tknow what went wrong as it didn't sync anything at all in my new mobile, that is set up with android 9.0. Signing in fb wasnt any problem. That's why 1 out of 5. I also saw people reported the similar issue in the forum of the designer, but i didn't see any corresponding answer.", "Looks very interesting, but I unfortunately won't use it in its current state.   Why don't you use native Facebook authentication ?  I'm certainly not sharing and saving my Facebook credentials within some random app. This isn't secure at all...  Even if the dev is honest, that's definitely the way someone would hack your password.", "I love this app! It helps sync nearly all of my calendars into one place. For a while it didn't work due to FB updating something on their end, but it's now working again after me manually syncing. I don't use birthdays from FB so not sure if that had been fixed, but the events and their customizable colors are back up and running. When this app had issues, it really made scheduling and planning such an added chore. I tried downloading FB Local to resolve but had limited calendar view ability", "An update to my review on the 24th June 2019. Due to FB birthdays etc not appearing on users calenders the app was updated (a rollback) on the 14th July to try and fix the problems but unfortunately FB birthdays are still not appearing on my calendar but events do show now. Please have another look at the FB birthday issues because it's hardly worth having the app if FB birthdays do not show on my calendar. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app but still no birthdays showing.", "I'm trying the app for the first time since facebook ics with Google Calendar sync has some trouble lately. First Sync seems to work. I'll see if automatic sync is working. Would it be possible to to sync the events into any webcal ? Even a read-only calendar would be a huge improvement to visualize calendars from any computer !", 'Worked great for a while. Now it wont even sync. Not worth the download.', "nice app. sync is done seamlessly and works well. the only drawback is that it creates separate calendars (in seperate account), therefore events are not visible in google calendar environment in web. this app doesn't sync back to google.", '"Login Failed: You can\'t use Facebook to log into this app or website because there\'s an issue with its implementation of Facebook Login." displays when I try to Login, is this a bug? Because I tried several times (wrote right both my mail and password). Great UI btw.', 'The best Facebook sync app by far, I particularly like the way I can choose to only show "going" + "maybe/interested" events but exclude "not responded" + "not attending" + "birthdays" plus configure colours. Friendly developer too. Highly recommended!', "Something is making it so events and birthdays don't show. Please fix this.", 'Hi Developer Previously the app works however this time cannot sync my facebook events/birthday though i log in my account.

I've used HaxSync before devs discontinued that service, but then I was lost in my events and had to check Facebook app on mobile. This is great service, very easy to use, recommending it. Thank you, dev! üôÇ", 'Birthdays from Facebook all disappeared from calendars awhile ago. With latest update lost all events syncing as well. App force closes when sync is started every time.

But being used it for years, I'm quite certain that the developer will come up with a solution pretty soon;so still keeping the app. Cheers.", "Just doesn't work. It is not syncing to Facebook", 'I am using this app since longtime and something recently has broke and Birthdays no longer sync into my Google Calendar. Please fix ASAP! This was a Friendship Saviour app for long time now.. :)', "This app is not working. It just shows that it has synchronized facebook with the calender, but doesn't, in reality. It used to work earlier, before the update.", 'It works...FYI...If sync stops, uninstalled, power off/on, reinstall.', "used to work until yesterday, now it's stopped syncing birthdays. happened earlier too, a fix was issued on 14th July but the issue has recurred.", 'Since recent update App, keeps crashing.
