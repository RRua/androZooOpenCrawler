{'title': 'Morse', 'description': 'Translate text to Morse code or decipher Morse code by translating them to text! It‚Äôs a simple, user friendly, but useful app that can help you in a lot of ways. You can decipher or decode Morse codes, you can create secret number or learn to be a cipher or learn cryptography, and many more! If you think of yourself as a codebreaker, download and try our Morse code cypher tool!

The duration of the dash is three times the duration of a dot. Each dot or dash is followed by period of signal absence, called a space, equal to the dot duration. Morse code was first used for communicating via telegraph. The most well-known Morse code is SOS, which is used to signal an emergency. Aside from typing dots and dash, you can also signal Morse code by turning light on and off, sounding a horn or tapping, and many more.  You can use Morse code to transmit messages easily via various means if the recipient understands Morse code. If they don‚Äôt, they can use our cipher tool to find out the password, secret number, or any info you want to relay. \r\nSince people rarely communicate via telegraph, nowadays there are very few people who can memorize Morse codes. Instead, it has become a way to encode something or special characters for special purposes. Of course, these special characters are still widely used in many situations, you don‚Äôt know when you are going to really need it. It‚Äôs a useful language to know even if you just want to learn cryptography or cryptogram for fun. \r\n\r\nHow Morse is useful for you:\r\n1.\tTell others when you are in a dangerous situation (SOS).\r\n2.\tHide your secret number or password via dots and dashes. \r\n3.\tCipher/ Decipher hidden clues in games. \r\n4.\tLearn cryptography or cryptogram through learning Morse codes. \r\n5.\tBecome a codebreaker by breaking secret codes in real time translation. \r\n6.\tAnd many more! \r\n\r\nSo, what are you waiting for? Use our Morse code cipher tool to decipher Morse code to text or text to Morse code now! As a codebreaker & cryptogram enthusiast, our cipher tool is a must have! It is useful for all of you. Just try it out.\r\n\r\nWe hope that you enjoy using our cipher tool to decode, to learn cryptography, or other purposes. If you do, please support our Morse decoder app by giving a rating and review on our Google Play store page and/or a star on GitHub.
