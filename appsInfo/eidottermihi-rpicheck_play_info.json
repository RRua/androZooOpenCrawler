Would really like to see public IP address on the main screen and also an automatic refresh like at least every 5 seconds. CPU line graph or at least some more graphical stuff would be good too. I'd be happy to pay. Dropping an additional star for no updates in 10 months.", "It is nice and reports when I do a pull down on the device page for a refresh.
