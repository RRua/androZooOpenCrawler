I was using Feedly, which recently started injecting a lot of ads.  I tried a bunch of alternatives but am happiest with Sismics.  Sismics has you host your own feeds, on a PC.  The PC needs to be always on for Sismics to work.  Then you can either use a web app or this Android app to read your feeds.  What is nice here is that all your ways of reading -- multiple PCs, Android -- are in sync, so you don't see the same articles over and over again.  Since you are doing the hosting, there are no ads.  The interface is plain but functional.  Finally, it is really fast to load and stays current.  When you rely on someone else, they may not check for feed updates frequently, so some RSS apps lag.  This is a great solution!  If you read RSS frequently on several devices, either pay Feedly $5/month or use Sismics.", "Because it's not possible to configure the font size the reader is hardly usable on a tablet. But I like its clean and straight forward design.", 'Simple and beautiful app. Great project, thanks devs!', "Asked to download another program from the website, there's no indication as to which package to download or even why necessary. The 'standalone' all platforms version didn't work, got bored and removed. Sorry", 'The fact that you have made it open source makes the app much more useful.'], 'appId': 'com.sismics.reader', 'url': 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sismics.reader&hl=en&gl=us'}
