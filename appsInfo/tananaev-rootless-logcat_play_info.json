The bad reviews are from people who have not read and followed instructions given by the developer within the app or the Play Store listing. Kudos Anton for your ingenuity!', 'This app does exactly what it says it does, allows you to view the all logcat files on your phone without root. Those giving this app a bad review, do not understand how this works or what it is used for and should not use this app. A bit of history, when Google released Android 4.1, they changed the system so that an app can only read its logcat file and not others. For an app to read all logcat files, you either need root access or you need to issue a command using ADB on a computer. You cannot just install this app and expect it to work out of the box. To get this app to work, first you need to enable USB debugging in Developer options on your phone. ADB and this app need that to issue the command and access the logcat files. Then, you need to plug your phone into a computer that has ADB on it. Once it is plugged in, you need to open the command prompt on your phone, navigate to the folder with ADB, and then run the command "adb tcpip 5555." This app then uses remote debugging (acts like a PC to access USB debugging), so each time you open this app, you will need to allow the "computer" to access the phone.', "This app works as described. I rarely write reviews but some ignorant people who can't follow instructions a 5 year old can are blaming this app for viruses, robocalls and what not made me do it. The app works perfectly, is open source, virus free and is the best of its kind. kudos.", "Doesn't work if the phone doesn't have a working USB port (because you need to run adb logcat tcpip 5555), and the dead USB port was why I couldn't root my phone in the first place.", 'This app works perfectly on non-rooted phone because its reading the logs via TCP connection to the ADB server. I just wish I had a searching by date and time.', "The app description in the Play Store needs info on what _is_ needed for it to work. In order to avoid User's confusion. As I got, it doesn't work as is...", 'Dear Sir, the app works great! how do i filter using tags? can you give me an example please? Thank you for your hard work!', 'Great app. It would be wonderful if you add RegEx to search & Filter box.', "This doesn't work at all. Then when i reinstalled it the same message popped up.

I love it!!!', "App works great, exactly as advertised: root isn't needed", "App works as described. Don't worry about the negative comments.
