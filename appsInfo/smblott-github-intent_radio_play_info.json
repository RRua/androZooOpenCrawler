But I learned that if you do not include  "url:" and "name:" it will start playing "BBC 4 (FM)" always. ;)  But I can\'t get it to completely stop.

The program stays active in the notification-bar. How do I STOP/EXIT/KILL the "Intent Radio"???', 'Light weight streaming service, easy to construct a Tasker based radio alarm clock.
