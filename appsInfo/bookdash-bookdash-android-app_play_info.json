And I have to say that I am so happy and excited to have come across this app! All the other apps i tried before this one either claimbed to be free but weren\'t, or doesn\'t allow me or my children to be able to read them on our own if we want. They are only audible. This one is what it claims to be! I love it so far!! Keep it up :)', 'My kid loves this app. It is free and easy to use. I always buy books and they are really expensive.

Thank you for your hard work and for improving the lives of children all over the world.', 'Good free reading for kids. A couple of changes could make it better.

A few people complaints about the app only offering African inspired books. That information is clearly stated in the description. If you want to read more diverse books then make an free app that offer uunlimted reading or shut up. Apparently, the apps that offer diverse books charge. You can also just pay the money if want some diverse books.', "My son loves to read from this free library more than the actual book. Few books are there & it's free.
