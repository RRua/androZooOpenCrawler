Currently, exiting the app quits the puzzle you are working on.  Since the initial squares are filled in at random, I'm not sure what percentage of puzzles are technically solvable in the allotted number of moves even if you play perfectly. Perhaps it's more like solitaire games such as Klondike, where losing a lot of the time is expected. Or maybe I'm just thick.", 'This is a great little puzzle game. Check out my review on PoG Vlog!
