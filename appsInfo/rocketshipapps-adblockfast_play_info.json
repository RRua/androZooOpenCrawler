As I wrote this review I have 5 ads pop up! SMH!!!", 'I like the fact the program is "on the job" by keeping at bay annoying, cluttering ads. Also, I enjoy the "history" function that enables me to go directly to a favored site. Finally, it does not hurt when it "toots its own horn" by informing the user of how many ads were blocked on the previous page. Keep up the good work !', 'Omg this works because I haven\'t heard it, it was an inappropriate ad and it has sounds it just pops up out of nowhere saying "do not play this game when you\'re under 18" loudly and plays dramatic music, thank you.

If anyone knows what I should do, please tell me.", "This thing is almost perfect. Most of the bad reviews are from people who don't know how it works.
