(but only just installed it) only complaint is that when editing from "custom keys" list, the entries can be swiped (left) to be removed... I had already deleted 2 by the time I realized what was happening. I think there needs to be an "undo" button that pops up, or remove the swipe and possibly add checkboxes to use instead... I have been looking for this app for seriously YEARS, glad to find it\'s finally a reality!', "WOW! Amazing project, literally. Hope it will add support to swipe through pages instead of click to change page. It is really a great idea sir. Also add a guiding line somewhere that If you are using gboard/indic keyboard, touch the 'browser icon' to switch to kboard.Had difficulty to find it out. At last, THANK YOU, VERY MUCH!", "Genius! Absolute genius! Exactly what I need! The fact that it's so modular is very nice. Though we need a more complete wiki of API we cand use.
