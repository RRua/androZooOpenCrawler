{'title': 'FTP Server', 'description': "This program allows you to run an ftp server on your android device. This means that any other computer/device can access the files on your android device while the ftp server is running. For example, entering 'ftp://...' in the firefox url bar will allow you to browse the files on your device from a desktop pc or a laptop.\r\n\r\nBy default, the user name and password are both 'ftp', you should change them. You use this user name and password when accessing the server.\r\n\r\nFor power and security reasons, it is recommended that the server be stopped after use.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n* Complete and efficient FTP Server\r\n* Can read/write internal memory and also external storage (see advanced settings)\r\n* Implements advanced FTP features like UTF8, MDTM and MFMT\r\n* Implements Bonjour/DNS-SD for easy service discovery\r\n* Can automatically connect on selected wifi networks (work/home/...)\r\n* Can be started/stopped by Tasker or Locale, is thus also a Tasker/Locale plug-in\r\n* Anonymous login possible (with restricted rights for security)\r\n* Configuration of chroot directory possible (default sdcard)\r\n* Configuration of port possible (default 2121)\r\n* Possible to keep running while screen off\r\n* Runs on local network, even when tethering (phone is the access point)\r\n* Has public intents to support scripting:\r\n  - be.ppareit.swiftp.ACTION_START_FTPSERVER\r\n  - be.ppareit.swiftp.ACTION_STOP_FTPSERVER\r\n* Follows Material interface guidelines, looks good on phone/tablet/tv/...\r\n* Uses notification to remind user that the server is running\r\n* Easy starting/stopping server from settings\r\n* Has widget to ease starting/stopping server\r\n\r\nThe server is completely implemented in the app itself, it does not use an external library. It provides the best possible performance on android to run. Some advanced features like UTF8, MDTM and MFMT are implemented. Though the underlying file system must support them.\r\n\r\nThe Bonjour/DNS-SD support is very handy if the client os and it's file manager also supports the protocols. In this way, the moment you start the ftp server on the android device, you will find it on the network folder of your desktop.\r\n\r\nA lot of users asked if it was possible to automatically start the server when the android device was running. We found that it was more useful to automatically start the server when we are connected to certain wifi networks. This has the same effect and is very handy, for instance when you arrive home, start your ftp server. We then went even further and we added support for Tasker or Locale. The people who like to script some use case for there device can thus easily do that.\r\n\r\nLogical settings are available, like you can for instance set anonymous login and configure chroot and port. A minor group of users have some special use cases. For instance running the server while tethering or running the server from the ethernet cable. All those are possible and we are open for more improvements.\r\n\r\nThe design follows the official guidelines. You can be sure that the interface and the logo's look good on your device.

Coolest tool especially when your phone's usb ports or data cables are not working.", '"Could not read file" --Dolphin Most files can be seen but not transferred.', "it didn't allow me to mount harddrive connected to mobile", 'I especially love the very first item when you turn it on: It tells you its url. Makes it easy to connect to from another computer, tablet or phone. Hooks up immediately, transfers as fast as wifi will go. Thanks!', "Been using the demo version for a while now, decided to purchase to support \ndevelopment. Works flawlessly. It's simple and reliable. Keep up the great \nwork!", 'The best app for FTP in the market', 'On Android 6 you can not write to external SD card, so the app is useless if you want to do any automatic 2 way sync with PC. The developer was very prompt to reply. I give the app a 3 star only for that, given that the product in itself it is useless to me. No plans to fix the issue anytime soon, so try the demo before you buy.', "Doesn't seem to hàve access logs", 'Absolutely wonderful, simple fast reliable and a love the dark theme !', "A really neat little app I had to support. Also it's open source, a rarity with Android apps.  Using FileZilla I can transfer files all without a cable on my local network.", 'I guess I don\'t know what "Runs on local network, even when tethering (phone is the access point)" because when my phone is a Hotspot, the app self-assigns an IP in a completely different range from the IPs the phone is assigning to devices tethered to it, thus making the server inaccessible to said devices. I emailed the developer and received  no response. Too bad. The Tasker plug-in feature was nice.  EDIT:Developer did respond and fixed the issue with the IP.  Works great!', 'Worked flawless on my NEXUS 6P until I upgraded the OS to the latest version of Android (7.1.1 official). Seems that it does not read properly the internal storage anymore. I hope it will be fixed soon.', "Wasn't a bad app when it worked, but with the new update it can no longer access the SD card rendering it pretty much useless cause the rest of the system denies access from other users...great", "Exactly what an app should be.   Works perfectly.  Interface is simple and provides the user with the information needed. Puts the on/off switch right on top.  Best of all, no cloud crap!!!  Running this on my CAT S60, Android 6.0.1 and paired with FileZilla on my Win 10 PC it's perfect for letting me view navigate and move files around on my phone and between my phone and my PC.  Please don't change it any more than needed to stay compatible with Android updates!!", 'Loved it, can be started with FTP via USB Tethering, others only available on Wifi Tethering. (Oneplus X, Marshmallow)', "Stops and exits immediately on HTC One S even though the store claims it is compatible.  Always loved this app on previous phone, but it should say clearly it's not compatible", 'Best FTP server on market. Clean, simple, stable, correctly works with UTF-8. PS: add light theme, please!  :-)', 'Works well, way more convenient than connecting my phone to my pc every time I want to transfer a file.', 'What it says on the tin. Widget and everything.', 'thanks for fixing the UI again after the last update. Been using this app for over 2 years now. Always does a perfect job.', 'Great app', 'Simple UI and just works!', "It's helped me transfer large files, so it works as expected. For the most part...  It also crashes my LG G Pad every time I turn the server off and on again.", 'Great simple FOSS FTP server. Makes transfering files in and out easy and fast without any cable.', 'Simple. Brilliant. Worth supporting development.', 'Would appreciate it if the app could use the Wi-Fi tethering option on the phone. Otherwise, just great', 'SwiFTP is gone, but its code has been polished and continued to be used for this app. Well done!', 'Nice app. I bought it because it follows Holo interface guidelines, but the icon really should be updated for full compliance. I am convinced it would make the app much more appealing.   An anonymous login option would also be nice.', "I want to run this over an insecure network, so plain FTP isn't an option", 'Causing reboot', 'Permissions are minimal, easy to use, worked flawlessly with FileZilla on Linux.
