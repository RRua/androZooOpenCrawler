After pairing my phone with my fitbit and opening the app, i see a blue message on bottom trying to connect, then it flashes something in red that goes by too fast to read and nothing happens.', "Will not connect band, the most essential part and you can't achieve it. Thanks for wasting my time", "Calculator tile does not work :'( It gives syntax or exceptional error on phone screen.my friend accidentally reset my watch .i cant use it now :(((", "Download the app my Android phone couldn't get the watch to sync up couldn't get nothing to go on kept telling me Java are the worst thing I've ever bought", 'Keeps saying "connecting" without actually connecting.', "Never connected to Microsoft Band 2...don't waste your time.", "I reset my band now it's not connecting what can I do any alternative aap", "Doesn't connect to band.

I'm not an Android \nfan,but this makes my switch a little less painful as the last MS remnants \nvanish in the mobile and fitness market. Thanks!", "I love it it's really useful but the only thing I don't like is the calculator doesn't work and I can't use the remote camera button other than that I love choosing my own background and theme colors and having music control", "I really love this app, it's very comprehensive and has extras to boot. You can tailor your band 2 to exactly how you want it to appear. Many fitness watches in 2018 pale in comparison to how flexible the band and the app work together.

Now i just plant my phone where it's facing me working and snap away. Couldn't recommend more", "Love all the sensor data in real time. A couple questions: 1) can this replace the Microsoft Health App? Since the Health App is brutal. Is it possible for sensor data to be sent to my Microsoft Health account (or another health tracking service)? 2) is uploading all this data in real time going to drain my CPU, network, battery, etc? Since the Microsoft Health App only updates at certain intervals, not in real time.  EDIT: Thanks, so does the app upload in real time when it's running in the background?", 'This app made me fall in love with my MS Band 2 even more, the extra data provided by the sensor is a killer plus all the customizable options.
