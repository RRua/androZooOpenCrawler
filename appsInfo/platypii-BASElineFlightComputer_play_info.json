{'title': 'BASEline Flight Computer', 'description': 'BASEline is designed for skydivers and BASE jumpers to improve wingsuit flight performance through data analysis and real-time audible feedback. With BASEline you can:\r\n\r\n<b>1) Record sensor data from your phone</b>. When you click record, the app starts logging all GPS, altimeter and accelerometer data to a CSV file. You can automatically sync these track files to https://baseline.ws/ using your google account. The data can be analyzed later to determine flight profiles for your BASE jumps and skydives.\r\n\r\n<b>2) Optimize your flight by speaking your speed and glide ratio</b>. This feedback is helpful when learning to maximize wingsuit performance. Click the audible button to configure audible settings on your phone, including horizontal speed, total speed, and glide ratio.\r\n\r\n<b>3) Display your position, altitude and speed</b>. On a map you can set a home location to assist with navigation, display you current trajectory and projected landing zone. BASEline also includes an analog-style altimeter, and real-time polar chart.\r\n\r\n\r\n<i>Disclaimer: User agrees to take full responsibility for the use of this software.
