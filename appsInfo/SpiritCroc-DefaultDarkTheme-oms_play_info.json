The app was tested on a galaxy j3 with lineageos 14.1 as the os and magisk as the superuser manager. Those who leave bad reviews saying that it "doesn\'t work" without adding anything else to their argument are not the target audience for this app and their opinion should be weighed as such when evaluating the app.', "The app won't show me the dark move setting, when i open the app, it didn't show since I have a budget 2019 version LG Phone. Don't download this with any LG Tribute phones out there in the market.", 'Dunno why there are so many negative reviews. This works perfectly fine for me and it‚Äôs the best dark theme out here! Most of the themes are paid, but he built it for us for free. There is another free dark theme but that‚Äôs actually themed pure black, so it didn‚Äôt look well to my eyes. This app deserves my 5 stars and I will give another 5 stars from my 2nd account.', "The developers know there is a problem with this app but refuse to fix it. They say that if you dont know what a substratum is, then you should just uninstall immediatly even though they include a link to a substrarum next to it. The subtrarum doesnt work by the way. They also rudely tell you to not leave a bad review even though it is their fault that the app wont work and it's their fault they won't fix it. They put the blame on you for not knowing advanced developing terms.", "Even though it works as expected, the developers should tell the person what it is, not everyone knows everything, and you don't have to punish people by not knowing how to use it. But great app, it makes it easier to use my phone in the dark. Btw it also helps you if you click on the link in the app. Lol", 'People are like "Haha this app sucks I don\'t know how to use Google to search what Substratum is and why it is not working on my device so 1 star" ***k you. Substratum is a theme app that needs ROOT ACCESS to run on Android 7 and 9 (I might be wrong with 7 but 9 requires root for sure) Also theme isn\'t bad', "I use this theme on most of my Google-free setups (no Play Store). About the only free and regularly updated theme AND available via F-Droid. Works fine on all ROMs where I use it including some without OMS like LineageOS 14.1. Don't know why it's rated so low.", "Don't know why so many users are leaving bad reviews. At least read the description before installing! It's perfect working with my stock oreo. No issues I've found so far. Thanks for keeping up the development, waiting for more apps support.", 'Really nice simple customizable "substratum" theme capable of pure black backgrounds for the system interface. Love the purple on black. Thanks Dev. Great Work!', 'Share menu is still white with white text, so it is pretty much impossible to read the text. Could you fix this? Thanks', 'It\'s not working. When I open it, it shows black screen. And in the upper right corner. When I tap it, it says " I know what I\'m doing".', 'Dark mode everything. Add theme overlays for GApps (especially Play Store, GMail and Calendar) and this is a 5 star rated app for me. Great work done, devs. Cheers!', "Really nice theme üëç I would advise users to read all instructions and seek assistance if they don't understand something.", 'Giving a 1-star review because you downloaded an app called "Default Dark Theme for Substratum" and then don\'t know what substratum is or how to use it- only out\'s you as a moron! Although I use SwiftDark as my primary theme, I use this one because it\'s the ONLY theme I\'ve ever found that gives you transparent notification shade and transparent notifications on your lock screen. And the effect is stunning... and if we use the Oreo settings that works perfectly in Pie as well; ignore the idiots.', 'System UI worked well in 7.5 version.. Now not working.. In 7.6.. Do fix it..', "Fails to apply and makes substratum crash.

If you're into having a dark theme, Default Dark is my top recommendation.", "does not work properly on my phone.

After opening app it dont show any thing..

You may be bitter about people giving you 1 star reviews because their device doesn't support Substratum themes, but essentially calling potential customers dumb and demanding they don't give 1 star is always a policy that gets my back up.", 'Substratum not found Message come, not work', 'not installed this fake app it required to download substratum and nothing will happen.', "Awful app, it doesn't work at all", 'This is litle bit awessom but have some error that made this app rating low', "wht didn't it change? i am on android 7 subtratum installed with root, subtsratum wont change anyhing even with other themes", 'You should have explained what Substratum is in your first Home page for app instead of asking people to not to review it bad... It is fair...', "I don't know why people are giving horrible reviews!! Learn how to use it before you post your stupid comments üôÑüôÑüôÑ It IS one of the few freely available decent themes for substratum, I like it.
