{'title': 'Retro Breaker', 'description': 'Retro Breaker is a simple brick breaker game with an old, retro appearance. This game was created for the Mobile Computing course (MAC5743) on IME-USP, 2014 class. It has the following game mechanics:\r\n\r\n-Retro graphics: no textures, just plain colors and simple animation;\r\n-Sound effects: different sound effects for each possible game event (e.g. hitting a brick, hitting a wall, hitting the paddle...);\r\n-Score multiplier: each time the ball breaks a brick, it increases the score multiplier for the next hit. If the ball hits the paddle, this score multiplier is reduced. If the player loses a life, this score multiplier is reset. This is to incentive the player to hit consecutive bricks;\r\n-Multiple brick types: there is four types of brick, each one with a special property.\r\n-Random generated levels with different difficult settings: there are three different difficult settings (Easy, Normal and Hard; except for "Can\'t die" that exist mostly for debugging purposes, since you can\'t score); each difficult has a different number of stock lives, hit score, max score multiplier, ball speed and generates a random level with the number of special bricks according to a probability.\r\n\r\nThis game has pretty simple mechanics, like the original game. If you feel even a little bit of nostalgia, our objective was completed.\r\n\r\nThis game is open source, and it\'s available at GitHub (https://github.com/m45t3r/retrobreaker) on MIT license.', 'descriptionHTML': 'Retro Breaker is a simple brick breaker game with an old, retro appearance.
