Thanks for reading my review.', "It certainly deserves more star ratings but for now I am rating it 3 because the app is a great start and quite helpful for people whose phones don't have Ambient Display, but it needs a bit more improvement. I use it as an Ambient Display and not the Always On way, so for me the Raise to Wake feature doesn't work quite well. It's always a hit or miss thing. Tried tweaking sensitivity but no help. When the device gets locked it takes a huge time to get activated. Double tap to wake doesn't work", 'Almost perfect, my phones screen has trouble turning on, so I\'ve quit turning the screen off, with this app I use the "play" button inside the app and leave it black until I need to use the phone, however, this also means I can\'t lock my phone. I have 3 suggestions, 1 A widget which goes straight to the dark/watch screen, without opening the app, 2 preventing screen rotation to turn on the screen, only allowing the taps/swipes, 3 An optional independent lock screen that prompts after "waking."', 'Application deserve 5 star rattling but after a priod of use. well well... after installation and uninstalled many poor Application. i find this Application as night clock. and its pretty good and friendly use. i will give five star afer some days of inuse.', "Tried it and have now un-installed it because for me unlike others I've tried it doesn't work automatically when you turn the phone to standby, you have to go into the app and physically do it. Also I sent myself an email from my tablet and the screen did nothing,", "Excellent. This is exactly what I was looking for long time and works perfectly on my Nokia 8. But it does drain a battery other than it's superb.Thanks a lot.", 'Upon placing my finger on the FP sensor it does not dismiss the AOD screen after it unlocks with the phone saying "Phone Unlocked With Fingerprint" in a white message above the screen.

Would not recommend, but if you have the free version, make the best if it.', 'This was the 1 thing my new phone was missing from my old galaxy S7, AOD, but now I can still have it :-)', "I love it. It looks great on my new Samsung A30S. Looks like real aod. No problems. Adaptive light working also. Just don't know if it will battery life by much.", "The app is really good and doesn't consume a lot of battery. The best part about he app is it's clock customisation and font edit options. I would have given 5 but the Ambient display still stays on me screen until I double tap even after unlocking", "Works well. Like the ability to change the font size on the clock display. However, I can't seem to get it to turn the clock display off. I have the display timeout set as low as it will go (20sec) but it never turns off. Suggestions?", "I loved it, I didn't waste time to go for the premium 👌", 'I love it. The best thing is to have the current weather on the screen that is always in view.

I used this app on a mi 9t which has an amoled but I have switched temporarily to a Huawei P8 lite 2017 as I was having some issues on the 9t, they were unrelated to this app however. The contrast on the LCD panel of the p8 is pretty good so if Im in an illuminated room it fakes the effect of amoled pretty well. No complaints so far, the ads are not too jarring either.', "Features are good, but the app doesn't always seem to work in the background. It crashes and i have to go to the app to enable the service again. Im using OnePlus 5T.", 'works ok sometimes . sometimes doesn\'t activate the quick setting button not always working either to turn in or off.. also drawings can\'t be saved even though there is"option" to save on bottom left of screen...

Just needs a little organizing when it comes to the settings.', "Largely works as described. Many features locked behind payment. Only thing I encountered is that my OP 7 pro ambient display overrules the app on double tap to wake, I hope that's fixable. Will buy if that's fixed since I wanted to be able to customize my ambient display. Also there seems to be a 'join the beta' option but I don't see information with specifics on what's in the beta.", 'To the developer of App and pro: Please advise if its safe to use this app on phone with LCD screen and will not cause any damage to phone or LCD screen.
