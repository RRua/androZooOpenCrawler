I can't win anything. Every game I am getting angry and i smacked a lot of controllers. But this.. I gave it a try and I am in love with it. I don't even have to play. I just start the game and the controller does it for myself. Incredible work. Now i have 1000 winf from 1000 matches. At the start I thought I will brake my phone like the other controllers but no. It makes me the best player. I might sign myself for a pro contract. THX!!!!", 'Very good app!
