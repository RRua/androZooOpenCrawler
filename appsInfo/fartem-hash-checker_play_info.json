Now see, I mainly use the app strictly for CRC-32 (video) checks and it would be great if there was an option for this to be chosen as the default choice checker somewhere in the settings. Now on to my bug, I think it's great to have the checker in the Open File With Context Menu, but when I open a file this way, the app opens up but forgets my file choice and I have to navigate to it once again", 'Unnecessarily gets associated with all file formats', 'Thanks for this, great design for usability. Make dark theme default please. Nearly blinded me üòé', "This is what exactly I want.. but some quick suggestions for next update. 1. Add another hash for text that is base64, you'll be able to do it in no time I believe. 2. Add a recent or fav. Section for most used hash types so you don't have to go through the list everytime. 3. UI can be improved more. 4. Rather than inserting a hash, Allow adding 2 files to compare between. That will be more comfortable. Rest I liked your app, keep up the good work, looking for future updates üòÉüòÉ", "Simple app and does the job. However I would like to suggest something, add support for checking hashes with files directly. I mainly use this for checking the integrity of Linux iso files. Most come with a .md5sum or .sha256sum file attached and I can't open those files. Have to manually look for hash on website.", "Wow. An android program that does everything it's developer claims of it, with both efficiency and intuitiveness. What's more, it comes with a free and open source, and doesn't try to either track the user or pester him with adverts. Extraordinary!", 'Should be easier to compare files than it is. Having to copy/paste hashes etc.', 'Excellent. I really appreciate having an option for those long hash check sums being able to read without being bunched together. Thank you.', "CRC32 Hash results always lost a leading zero. I compare hash results from this app and the others, yeah the results are always lost a leading zero from the hash. This is an example from one of results 2dc565f it's should be 02dc565f", 'No useless ads. Fast hash generator and beautifulllllllllll UI. You could make the existing EditTexts to material EditTexts(I think this would look more beatiful).', 'Great app but if developer can move this app to SD card storage.
