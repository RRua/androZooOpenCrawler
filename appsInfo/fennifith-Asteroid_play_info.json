{'title': 'Asteroid', 'description': 'Asteroid is a simple game based on avoiding asteroids. Despite having the same name as the popular arcade game "Asteroid", Asteroid is very different from Asteroid. In this game, the objective is to avoid all the asteroids, similar to how the objective in Asteroid is to avoid all the asteroids, however there are many significant differences between this game and Asteroid. For example, in this game, the asteroids are purple. Asteroids are not normally purple, but in this game, they are. Also, this game is published on GitHub under the Apache 2.0 license. Asteroid is not published on GitHub under the Apache 2.0 license, unless it is, in which case I haven\'t seen it yet. Which is another difference between this game and Asteroid.\r\n\r\nGitHub: https://goo.gl/YUjWeS', 'descriptionHTML': 'Asteroid is a simple game based on avoiding asteroids.
