A necessary app in the arsenal of tools for a rooted phone. I\'ve used it for so long, taking it out only when I need it and then freezing it.

Does not work at Android 10 Samsung device. Even after giving all adb permissions, program works till first reboot. Then just writes: "fall back" to "since boot". Author refuses to fix it or refund money. Do not buy it, tooking the bait, be careful', 'One of my all-time favorite apps.  This single-handedly saved me.  My unrooted stock Moto G5 Plus kept showing very high Keep Awake times for "Android OS" and "Google Play"...not very helpful.  BBS allowed me to not have to root (and reset) my phone and see exactly what was causing the wakelocks that were spiking my CPU and draining battery.  Cannot recommend this app enough.', 'Wow! Works on OP6 on Android 10! After upgrading to 10, had terrible screen off time. Saw CPU was not going to Deep Sleep state. Wanted to try something other than "wipe the phone and see if that fixes it".

Saved me so much time vs resetting!', 'Great! Was finally able to diagnose standby drain that only happened while moving - when turning off all location settings in all apps and system did not help. Was the HORRIBLE and rouge google rewards app that kept wakelock but more importantly caused GPSD wakelocks... even when asked NOT to provide surveys on places visited AND location history turned off in account.

Raw statistics are empty except for Alarm and CPU states and charts are empty. I got a message "batteryinfo service cannot be contacted". I configured the app for English but still the interface is localized. Maybe that some problems are related to the device - Samsung A50, Pie - but I give 1 star because the behaviour of the app looks buggy and above all the developer has not bothered to answer to my support request.', 'Paid for it since it was so low priced. Waste of money, it will not tell me anything about my power usage on a galaxy s10.', "Haven't even used this app yet and it's getting 1 star. Just trying to OPEN the app crashed my phone twice, and it refused to open at all for about 10 minutes (sat on a blank white screen, crashed my launcher, locked my phone up and sent me to the lockscreen). Finally after reboots and force closes I got the app to request root, which it then locked up and I couldn't allow root through the magisk dialogue so it auto-denied after the timer ran out, and I had to go manually enable root in the magisk app, at which point it will FINALLY open properly. This app has some really serious issues and is an awful experience to start up.", "Hi, I have an un rooted Huawei P20 Pro, have done the adb grant thingy. However it's showing since unplugged 7 days.
