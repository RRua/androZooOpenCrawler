I was too, so I wrote this app!\r\n\r\nThe Pretty Good Music Player is an open source (GPL) folder-based music player with no frills.

I added this because it was annoying when my phone was in my pocket and would auto-pause because the headphone cable was bumped.\r\n- Plays .mp3, .m4p, .m4a, .aac, and many more types of audio files.\r\n- Accepts play, pause, previous, and next commands from Bluetooth headsets.\r\n- When you select \'All songs\' for a given artist, the songs are ordered by album, not alphabetically. \r\n- Automatically pauses and resumes when another app (e.g. GPS) needs audio.\r\n- If another app needs audio for more than 30 seconds (e.g. a phone call), it does not automatically resume. \r\n- "Repeat All" is always on.\r\n- If you click "back" too quickly, it double checks that you want to leave before quitting.\r\n\r\nExpected Folder Layout:\r\nIt\'s designed to work with artist folders copied from iTunes.
