Edit: Ads are a recent addition in the latest version and can be disabled in the app options.', 'Ugh. Can someone just make an app that lets me copy text using my already downloaded fonts? This app makes it look like you can do that, but the copied text just goes back to default font when you pate it in another app. Waste of time.', 'Really useful app, especially the find function Also announcing the ad banner in an Update Note and making it optional is a great move! For that alone I will keep it activated', "it's doesn't work. when i write something, it's can't show the word or letter. so please tell me how working it's?", 'Its very difficult to select font.every time to select manually select font.

I just recently learned the Runic Alphabets, and I was trying to figure out how to type it on my phone, I had no idea that it was this easy. This app has opened up a whole new world for me, Unicode. It makes typing so much easier and more fun. Now I can type in Viking Runes as if on a normal keyboard.
