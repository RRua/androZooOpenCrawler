{'title': 'OGN Viewer - FLARM Radar', 'description': '<b>What is OGN:</b>\r\nThe "Open Glider Network" (OGN) is a network of HF receivers maintained by gliding enthusiasts mainly in europe which listen to signals of flarm devices (or compatible) and OGN trackers. The "OGN Viewer" connects to the OGN and visualises the received data.\r\n\r\n<b>How to use:</b>\r\nThe area the OGN viewer shows is given by the aprs filter. You can choose between "Moving APRS filter" and "Manual filter" (see in the settings).\r\nThe "Moving APRS filter" an area around the current point. The area is visualized by a red circle (dotted line). You can set the radius. If you change your position, the circle is automatically updated.\r\nIf you set the "Manual filter", you can create the area by (long) pressing on the map. The dialog offers you the manual filter string for a circle with radius of 100km. If you confirm the dialog, the area is visualized by a red circle (continuous line).\r\n\r\nStart the OGN viewer and set up the aprs filter. If you leave the filter empty you will see the whole OGN traffic and this could make the app slow. If you make a long click on the map, the filter dialog will appear with a filter for the range 100km around the point you clicked.\r\n\r\n<b>How to use with XCSoar:</b>\r\nWith OGN viewer you can feed the OGN stream to XCSoar. GPS has to be enabled. Also enable the "TCP server" in the settings. Then start XCSoar and add an additional NMEA input under Config->Devices->Edit:\r\n\r\nPort: TCP client\r\nIP Address: localhost\r\nTCP Port: 4353\r\nDriver: Flarm\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n1. the current version of XCSoar cannot handle multiple Flarm sources. So if XCSoar is already connected with a "real" Flarm this feature will not work.\r\n2. targets up to 2km are not shown.

To the dev: can LK8000 connect to OGN Viewer in the same way that XCSoar does?  If so, could you add instructions to the description?  Also, from what I understand, a pilot using XCSoar has to make a choice to either connect a FLARM beacon, to transmit their location, OR use OGNViewer, to see other OGN aircraft on its map. Surely this defeats the purpose?  Thus, does LK8000 allow connecting FLARM and OGN Viewer to send and receive simultaneously?', 'I wish this app had a moving map function with gps so I could use it in flight too', 'Great App, particularly how it integrates into XCSOAR. Apart from Traffic info, allows you to get a view on climb rates of others outside your own FLARM cover and get a view on thermal conditions ahead of you.
