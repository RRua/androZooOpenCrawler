Kindly introduce 'play' button to make us navigate through a game easier rather pressing 'next' button again and again. 2. Kindly make it possible for us to rename certain games that we store within a file. For example i wanted to study certain lines of Caro Kann. I can save all the games within the file 'Caro' but i could not name the games i saved within that and so i could not differentiate the variation in caro kann lines. 3. Camera option to directly bring position.Tq", 'Awesome app. The very best. I would suggest that the stockfish chess engine be updated (via the latest Stockfish Development Version) during each new version, instead of updating the Stockfish chess engine for Droidfish only when there is a new Official Stockfish release. This will help android users be on the same page with Windows PC users. Thank you.', "Excellent.. But want your advice Peter sir !!! i plays with 2048 mb hash.. 100% book recommendations.. In one minute per move with 2850 Elo.. With other players in instant chess Then also i lost some matches on android.. Why this happened and what's your suggestions for change", "It's an amazing aap, only one concern faced i.e. after 60 moves it slow down considerably. Are you planning to add more moves in future update. I tried Whole game option also but invain. That is the reason for 3 star..I will give 5 star once this is resolved.", "Playing strength was gone in settings. I think you should keep that feature for using the other chess engines e.g komodo, texel, laser etc. because their limit strength feature isn't supported.", 'With your latest update, now i know you are using a weak engine (only 2850!). Prior to this update, i thought 100% strength was the present strength of stockfish 11 which is at 3700+. To this, from 5 stars i am giving you one', 'This is so awesome! Im terrible at chess and feel self conscious when playing real people. Playing the engine is a great way to build up some skill', "Almost perfect, but there is a issue that I found. (It doesn't show any comment in positions without king.) For example: there are lots of pgn out there that author want to speak about pawn structures and they show just pawns without even kings. and after that they come to analysing couple of games. You can see such a pgn in analyse this app but not here.", 'Almost perfect, if only there was a small gap between the buttons and the movement list. In many occasions when using the arrow buttons, accidentally touched movement list, and the game jumped to that step. Had to manually get the game back to the step I had been watching. It is a bit distractig. I changed the button size to Larger in Settings, but did not help as my finger-tips are big. Need some more space around the buttons. Thanks.', 'All I wanted was to go back to playing chess. Picked this app. It really does have a dozen of fatures that advanced players will appreciate but for me it lacks one fundamental feature, the layout. I am more focused on avoiding touching the field with list of moves that accidentally takes me into the twilight zone than on the game itself. Surprisingly the field is where my thumbs are. How about a swap? Maybe there is such option already available but got lost in the long list.', 'I like this app a lot. Wonder if it would be possible to implement voice control (both human vs machine and when the machine moves). This would permit to play with a normal board, rather than on devices...', 'Playing strength has changed. It is not anymore (100%.) In percentage. It is weaker now.', 'Very Impressive update, Now we can easily determine the strength of engine regarding its elo rating, job well done, i rate it 5 star for greatest update. Thank you and God bless. ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š', 'Excellent and just getting even better! After every update droidfish is becoming even better "best" chess app!', "I don't like the clock setup. I would prefer more options than just the Fischer increment. Including the Standard delay and Bronstein would be awesome. I personally prefer the Bronstein system when using western chess clocks. I also enjoy the byo-yomi system of Shogi and Go, and I do occasionally play real life chess games with that system, but honestly don't expect to see it in any kind of western chess program.", 'Recommended chess game...nicely built with smooth gameplay.', 'Only lacking is, there is no indication of check, kindly add this option But if there could be some indication on the chess board, eg circling the king piece, or changing the box color would be more easy for amatures to play.', 'great chess app. my problem is i cannot open my save game. can you help? thanks', 'Almost perfect. But if you can show the estimated ELO of the different strengths of the stockfish or the ELO of the player i.e. myself, it would help us to estimate our chess skills better.', 'Version 1.80 is an better like this version.
