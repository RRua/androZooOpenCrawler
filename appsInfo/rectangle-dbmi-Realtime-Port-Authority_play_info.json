A few issues: 1) It looks like buses disappear from the map when they leave their route (e.g., due to detours). 2) For the past few weeks, I get "No tracking data available for routes: 28X" (just for the 28X), even in the middle of the day.', "If It would let me rate no stars I would, so 1 star will do. Terrible, not very accurate or reliable. I've missed plenty of buses using this. Thanks but no thanks. Could use an update, more features, better accuracy.", 'The app quits stopping and it only shows in going not out going on the route P76 when you are leaving Pittsburgh', "Use to love this app but for the last month it won't show the 28X route at all. So now it's completely useless to me and everyone else who uses that bus. If they fix that I'd happily give this app 5 stars because it's been so useful to me over the years.", "Super useful, I'd pay a premium if there's a feature allowing me to put in the destination address where it'd pin on the map. It can be hard to switch back and forth between maps and this app.", "The app is glitchy sometimes (e.g., can't display a route even though it's midday), but overall it provides relatively accurate timing information in both a time estimate and a visual representation (you can see where the bus is on the route).", "The tracking is pretty spot on, but it loses connection to the servers extremely regularly and it's not obvious when it does. Reopening the app usually does the trick though", "this is THE BEST APP FOR THOSE WHO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT BUS THEY WANT. Lets make that clear. the others are for those who aren't sure. If this message is read by the PATtransit reps then HOW BOUT HAVING AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM WHERE U CAN ADD FUND TO UR C.CARD VIA THE PHONE. THE STATIONS ARE TOO FAR FOR MOST PEOPLE. HOW BOUT PERSONALISED CONECT.CARDS. how bout adding bank card swipe at $2.50 as well. lol PLEASE LET THEM KNOW OUR CONCERN'S", 'Pat Tracker is the most amazing app to navigate the PAT system. It out performs all other transit apps. Thanks to the creators, I rarely stand in freezing weather waiting on the bus!!', "I have cleared the transit history and pressed the transit I use and it still doesn't highlight the route in green like it used to but thank you for the tip.", "Many times the app doesn't let us track the bus , sometimes we need to restart the app , that's the only issue.", 'App is pretty accurate...I like the ability to know how long of a wait there is or how much time I have to make it to the stop.', 'Love this app. Very easy to use, great layout.', 'Used to work, now kept saying tracking data is not available.', 'When its working its amazing. However it always loses connection with Pat Transit server constantly, detour info goes to a invalid page.', 'App used to work great but for the past 2 weeks gives no info for the 28x bus which unfortunately the bus i use to commute everyday', 'It doesn\'t always show all bus routes and sometimes it shows a "ghost" bus', 'Very helpful with our bus line mainly accurrate I Love It In Pittsburgh.. Very Useful', 'Too many pat tracker offline try later deals when your trying to time the busses', 'Super helpful and accurate, I use this app every day!', 'Very accurate as far as the bus tracking', "It's good when it picks up the buses 😡😡😡😡 fix this issue please", 'This app is very precise. I use it 10-15 times each day. Highly recommend', 'The app is accurate enough and very useful for anyone who lives in or near Pittsburgh.', 'Its been not working for 2 weeks this is the best app', 'Useless if the bus drivers turn off their trackers', 'very useful & mostly accurate', 'great to know if you missed your last bus or it broke down somewhere', 'Love this app i always know where the bus is', 'Yeah been late for work twice because of this stupid app really need some glitches fixed', "it's very helpful unlike the realtransit", 'Only showing outbound 69 route', 'love this everyone should have it,never. know. when youll need it!', "Not so good anymore since the 28x doesn't track anymore", 'A must have if you ride public transportation.', 'i like the service', 'right on time', 'Ot really helps!', 'Its not perfect but it works. I use it quite often to catch buses and for \nthe most part it tells you where they are and when they will arrive. Some \nbuses of routes dont show up sometimes so download a schedule too to be \nsafe.', "It never works its always down. Never know when the next bus is due.
