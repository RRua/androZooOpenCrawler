Turns out that every Notebook created at the root level must have its own account login in the app, in order to sync. However, if you create sub-folders of a root folder, all those are included with that login.  In any case, updating my review, as this app works as I need it to. I would like to see rich-text formatting follow through in the app, however. For example bulleted lists don't render correctly.", "Sync overwrites newer updates from other clients, breaks line endings,  replaces non-English characters by question marks and syncs that back...  Love the idea of the app, hate losing notes like this.  Update / reply: I installed it together with getting a KolabNow account. My desktop client and KMail had been syncing the notes just fine, but as soon as I access them through Kolab Notes things go wrong. Even notes that were originally created there. The bits replaced by '?' chars was a Cyrillic address... I can understand not being able to display it, but finding out the address was gone in every client was less understandable. Worse so as I didn't actually modify the notes in Android, just opening them was apparently enough to trigger it. The overwriting issue is already in the Kolab bug tracker, I first thought it might be on their side. We did tests and the issue only occurs when Kolab Notes touches the note. Line endings are being converted to spaces in random moments, same thing there, without even editing a note, just reading triggers it.", 'It is a good notebook app. Renaming notebooks will make it more better, if that can be implemented.  Desktop Sync is also missing.', 'Sorry, The app works nice, but the main thing. Sync. I cant see nothing in the imap folders. I cant back up. I cant load in email program.  I have no control over it. This is the similar like Keep from google. It stores it somewhere and I cant manage the source data. And whats more, here you cant open in the PC. Means PC is out of using notes. Cant add foto.', 'I have lots of txt notes. How can I import them? I looked exported files and saw that they are xml format. Help please.

So if you make a note you can say, remind me in 10 days or a specific date?', 'There is no apparent way to create an account, there\'s no way to deselect local, and thus no way to configure it for sync. App should be able to create new accounts directly, it should not require going into the android settings themselves and going through the add account process there, it is counterintuitive.  EDIT: Issue largely remains, there is still no real feedback or guidance on adding accounts, though there is now a link below "change account" titled "system sync settings" which takes you to the sy', "Hope it's fixed fast.
