Edit: Good to hear there is a v2 in development!', "Been pretty solid for me for while. My phone popping up the weather is annoying, but that's on me, not the app.", 'i LOVE this app, i can see whoever is emailing or messaging me or whatever during any VR game. works great. i only wish i could donate monies to the cause to get the owner to update the desktop app from 2016 with more features like quick reply or voice reply or something. anything! :)', "can't get it to work at all, app is stuck on connecting forever, forwarded the ports, made sure app and pc server are up to date but it never worked..", "Unfortunately it seldomly works, but I like that it exists. Since the dev updates it frequently I am certain it will work properly soon. One thing I miss in the desktop app is an autostart feature. I often forget to start it before steamvr. Which doesn't matter since it often doesn't work anyways....", 'The program is awesome and works great, when I thought there was a problem with it the Dev was actively trying to fix it, eventually after a week we found the issue was with SteamVR and not this app.', "This app is awesome so far. Super easy to install and it's great to see my notifications while in VR. I saw there was a notification Hub that's not out yet, will I be able to reply to messages straight from VR, without taking off my headset and reaching for my phone?", 'Very useful', "The Vive app had one thing going for it which was the phone notification system, and it couldn't even do that very well. This app does phone notifications very well.
