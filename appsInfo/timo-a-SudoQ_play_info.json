I would happily pay for this app but it's free!", 'No ads is a 5star', "I love that it has no ads and asks for no permissions. The statistics are wanting though. Not very informative to list my best time from that one time I did a 4x4 when I'm usually doing infernal samurais. Better stats would indicate success rates, average scores, and best times across types.", "No ads, doesn't require permissions, clean and intuitive interface, lots of handy options for all types of players, lots of different types of puzzles and excellent difficulty scaling!", 'No special permissions required. Multiple varieties of sudokos. Stable. Also recently updated.', "Only app I can find that offers free samurai sudoku.  It may not have pretty graphics and easy UI, but it's a sudoku game....and it's free.", "I just got it and don't want to sleep. Love the Samurai puzzles. All five!!", "You just can't argue with that.", "This is quite possibly the best sudoku app I have ever used. I would love it if a future update includes 25x25 puzzles. I'm addicted to the 16x16 puzzles.  Edit: I don't know what Martina is talking about. Perhaps I don't have mine set up the she had hers.", "I have one major complaint... the generated puzzles are not symmetrical. I notice that a number of Sudoku apps ignore this restriction. If SudoQ could include the option to turn on symmetry, vertical, horizontal, both, it would be a much better program.  Update: As I work with the app, I have problems switching to gesture mode. And the instructions on the use of the app's menu are poor. Nice try.  But don't waste your time with this app.", 'Great variety of puzzle formats, 4 skill levels, challenging and very addictive.
