All their apps do what they say on the tin without grabbing unnecessary permissions or popping up with bothersome notifications you don't need to see. Wholesome and trustworthy. Get Simple, be happy.", "Perfect calculator. Numbers are supposed to be boring, I think. Right numbers, right equations, same darn answer *every* time! I've replaced any native app I can with yours. Thanks.", "Not good... you can't put a small shortcut on your desktop, and the widget takes up a full desktop page with numbers that are hard to see against any kind of photo background. Needs more work!", 'A replacement for the Google calculator that comes pre-installed in Android. This is a good alternative if you hate Google, otherwise there is no reason to use it as it ads nothing.', 'i am using your 4 apps permonent level.... i will suggest you to create your custom Rom with your apps... you have bright future.... and just go in same way.... your apps are light in size,no uses more RAM, keeeeeeep it upüòÄ', 'It does exactly what it says on the tin. No ads, no BS.', "I was helping my mom setup her phone and found that even the pre-installed basic calculater made connections to the internet. I don't 100% like how Simple Mobile Tools builds their apps, but they're way better than what comes with computers these days.", 'Does what it says on the tin, clean and simple. Also this app has zero trackers and zero permissions, so props to the developers for that üôå', 'Excellent. Very difficult to get simplicity these days. Only working widget calculator on the market. Thank you.', 'I like the privacy orientation of your development, however this calculator currently falls short for me. Really need a scientific calculator, not just these basic functions.', 'Even calculator is possible to do better than others.', "It's not simple, you have to hold down clear button to restart. You cant do correct math problems without restarting.", "Perfectly simple, but more than that, it has a themeable flat widget that allows custom colors. Which is exactly what I needed. I've been using it for way too long before realizing I hadn't reviewed it. It's one of those apps that is so simple, but useful you just don't think about it, even using it daily. That's a good thing.", "It's nice to have the dark theme for my calculator back after Google ruined the Stock Calculator application with a bright, white theme. But please, please allow an entire formula to be typed in before calculating rather than one number at a time!", 'Famn I thought I found the perfect calculator app! This looked very nice and clean, and had some awesome customizations. But I discovered there is no delete button to erase a digit if you hit a wrong one by mistake!!! That pretty much makes it useless. Uninstalled.', 'Great and very simple application! Huge amount of customisation for your pleasure. But only one little problem with percentage counts, they are really strange', 'Good But Widget Has Weird Glitch. Everytime I use widget at every third or fourth press it brings up my toggle screens. Is it supposed to do that? Kind of annoying. I have the donated version installed.', 'Does not show the selected operation in the widget window, meaning there is no way to know if you hit multiply or fat fingered the key and are actually subtracting untill after the fact.', "Hope more functions can be added to bring it to par with Google calculator. Really want to use this instead of Google's. Missing functions include trig, pi, a, log, ln, parentheses, etc.", "App doesn't support screen rotation, remains fixed in portrait mode.", "Fantastically simple calculator app with everything you need, and none of what you don't.", 'Simple, effective, and customisable.
