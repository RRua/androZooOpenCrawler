It doesn't support some disk image formats, and it doesn't commit changes to the provided System 6 hard drive image. If you're just looking for an Apple II emulator, skip this and use Apple2ix instead; but if for some crazy reason you have a IIGS game or app you want to run. this app ought to do the trick -- bearing in mind the above limitations.", 'Its awesome.
