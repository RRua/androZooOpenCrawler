The only thing I was not able to figure out was the Broadcast Intent feature, tried many different methods, bot nothing worked, would be awesome to be able to read the RSSI level of the Beacon in Tasker, in order to have more control over the sensitivity.', 'Found the beacon only once, allowing me to set up actions, but then stopped detecting it completely. The radar finds he beacon once every 10 or 12 times, but the scan never does. Never worked automatically in foreground or background. I was really excited when I found the app, because it is exactly what I needed... only if it worked.', 'update: got it working better now; app has to be in background to generate action. still a few bugs such as open url and get location both dont work. also actions can take up to 90 seconds to trigger. too slow. but overall a good start! original review: great idea and interface but not working for me. i received one out of zone notification about 5 mins after shutting off a beacon, which is far too slow. plus i could never get another notification again.', 'So, I get it, but what a huge battery hog. There are similar apps that scan less, or something, can be killed, or just used manually as needed. This literally cut my battery life in half just running in the background.', "Hasn't managed to find any cafes yet let alone bacon! Does it definitely work?", 'rare bt app that works ok', 'Not working', "Seems to be a bug that I can't get notifications to be silent.

With that said, it's one of the only beacon locator apps I found that alerts on entry.", "It is crashing on selecting any beacon.  Tested on Android 4.4, Android 5, Android 6.  On an Pixel C with Android 8.1 it lists no beacons.  What i'm doing wrong?", 'I really like the app, but I\'m not sure how to trigger Tasker? I have set up a Task called "Test" in Tasker, but I don\'t know what to write in the Action Parameter to trigger it?', "Works great! I couldn't get the Tasker option to work so I have Beacon Locator create a notification and I use AutoNotification to intercept the notification and execute a task in tasker.  Thanks for this excellent free app!", "Buggy, doesn't save config when trying to set up a trigger", 'Barely functional.', "This is the best beacon app that I have ever used for scanning and app for 3rd party.  Why don't you update scanning while a device is locked or in screen off? Also have interval option like Beacon Radar?", 'Seems to work well although not very responsive to detecting a beacon. How about a way to trigger a scan from Tasker or an intent (from Tasker)?', 'this app is the best in have used for classic and ibeacon scanning. the data given is exceptional.  well done', 'Works randomly, tried with two iBeacons and a simple notification.
