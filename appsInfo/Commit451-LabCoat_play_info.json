So if you're having an issue you probably did something wrong üòã", "Simply it doesn't work. I have a gitlab self-server and I've made an access token. But I can not login through LabCoat. The annoying part is that no error message appear on screen. \U0001f92f The project idea looks great but please solve the problems. Error message is a must for an application.", 'Great app. You should note that it handles multiple accounts in the app description too!', 'Not being able to log in. I have done the token protocol but keeps showing me an error...', 'I have just started with GitLab, but this app is really useful. I can browse the commits, files, comment on issues, even quick actions are working', 'Unfortunately no filtering of archived projects in general view.', 'Error login (android pie).', "This app is good at what it does-- providing a decent interface for catching up on updates with repos when on the go. It's not the most powerful work environment, but it's a mobile app-- what else could you expect?  A better and easier way of setting up authentication would be greatly appreciated, though. I wasn't expecting to have to set up a personal access token, but I understand why I have to, and it's not that big of a deal.", "A nice app, but it requires (does not ask, so you waste some time experimenting) an admin token when it seems to only expose read-only functionality to your account. A rather annoying limitation is that the files listing is capped and you can very easily find yourself unable to look at some files as they are unreachable in the UI (maybe the GitLab API for this uses paging and the app does not follow any 'next page' refeeences?).", 'keep getting failed to load', 'i think advanced features are optional for apps like these, this this get the job done', "Seeing all the completely unnecessary one star reviews for technical bugs, I just had to rate this app. It does what it's supposed to, namely providing me a convenient access to GitLab via phone, and it does so very well. I would recommend this app for anyone wanting to use GitLab while not being on the computer.", 'Forcing me to use personal access token? Utter garbage! What a tunnel vision way to do things. Long-time user here, but finally just totally fed up. Uninstalling, and downloading a much more flexible alternative. Good bye! Got a response from the dev, not acceptable, sorry. Hint: look up Glastnost. it does s better job in this case.', "Works good for me. My school uses GitLab for our projects and when I'm at work and need to do some small tweaks to my project settings this app so much better than trying to view GitLab on my phone.", "please add the ability to upload a zip file with my messages. also it doesn't appear to have the feature to filter the issues that I have raised personally. thank you for the application.", "Great interface, and really useful! Just a thing, when watching the logs a Pipeline job, I can't see the shell, I get an unrendered HTML of a Gitlab login (I think). Other than that, great app!", 'Logs and markdown dont print to screen in a coherent manner thats useful, and in fact logs are completely unreadable. Most management tasks regarding permissions or merge requests are impossible or too cumbersome to perform.', 'The app functionality is good. Feature: Added support for notifications on issues/milestone deadlines would be needed. Fix: The log of failed pipelines is not shown formatted.', "Excellent app, I have used it happily for years. Thank you dev! But can we please have a light theme? + Repo images haven't been showing for about a year or so.", "I just had to rate this. It's simple, does almost everything you might need of such an app.", '"failed to load" message on any issue I tried to open. Can\'t browse issues other than per project.

Cant view board. This is the most app that i would like to use, so grow your power please', 'not able to see pipeline or job logs. it shows html code of login page of my server.
