Thank you, Mr Santos!', 'Very useful app you can get apk from any app you have installed and also share anyone very nice application made', "Awesome app, would give 5 stars if there was an option to select all, apart from that it's great.", 'hopefully on sd card save apk back up', 'rated 5 stars because nearly perfect except one 1 huge thing. in your screenshot it shows a easy quick way to delete cache and data from your app but i dont see that in app. there are no options to delete app data and cache before uninstallation, not even a link to take me to the app info settings for manual deleting the data and thats a huge deal for me. when i delete my apks, i want every associated junk deleted!!! üò¢', 'The idea that there is no "select all" feature bewilders me and makes this app unusable for my needs. A shame too, since it\'s otherwise very well designed. Very disappointed too since this would be my app manager of choice hands down if I could actually use it for stuff. The idea that an otherwise great app for backups can\'t be properly used for app backups just because a developer left out a standard feature for apps like this is sort of absurd.', 'Android TV support is the only thing missing right now (Google Play for Android TV). :)', "I'm so glad I found this app! I like to save my favorite apps to my google drive so I don't have to look for them all over again... Such a hassle if you forgot the name or etc. I've been thru SO many apks apps & nothing compares to ML! I absolutely love it & it's awesome layout!", 'Love it! Fast and very easy to use. No root required. It worked flawlessly for apps I had installed in my phone, but were no longer in the app store. Also, no ads! Thanks dev!', "first, there is no select all option so you have to manually take off every single app if you want a full backup. second it doesn't recognize my SD card so I had to point it back to main storage at which point it died halfway through the back up. extremely disappointed", 'Great app thank you javier', 'Batch extraction is possible, but no batch selection, so each app must be individually selected one at a time! Needs a "Select All" option. A serious omission.', "Good app, unintuitive name.

Merci beaucoup.', 'Super.no need to say anything', 'best app .', 'When you review an app there are are a few prerequisite questions, you have to answer before leaving your written review. One of these is, "does the app meet your expectations?"... NO it does NOT! The app does not allow the user to disable system apps. It also forces the user to perform extractions, one at a time. I have over 300 apps on my phone! Batch extraction is the natural progression. I wouldn\'t have cared if these were abilities I had to pay for by purchasing the pro version. The fact that the app doesn\'t have it, just makes it a very good SECOND rate app. I have lowered my rating due to the enormous size of this app. A lot of games are smaller than this. It amazes me something can be so large while still missing important components. Has it been over eating?'], 'appId': 'com.javiersantos.mlmanager', 'url': 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.javiersantos.mlmanager&hl=en&gl=us'}
