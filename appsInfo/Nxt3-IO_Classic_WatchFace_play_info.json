Just disappointed since one of the preview photos seems to show a wide complication (showing a wide battery complication) but the app does not seem to support this feature. The most important complication to me is the notification preview, and this app doesn't seem to support that. I do like that it has the option to show a total notification count. I'd also like to be able to show hour numbers without the ticks/circle. - Thanks for the quick reply! I would love to see it added back in, I really like to look and customizability otherwise.", 'I really like all the options to customize the watch face. The only option that I would love to see added is to be able to turn the ring off but keep the tick marks on.', "Super minimal, super customizable. Personally I would like an option for just one hour marker (12 o'clock) and no complications on the AOD but this works.", 'I made a mistake! I had mine set to night mode where nothing would change! Thanks for getting back to me so quick.', "Easily the best minimalist watch face on the play store. It's light, it's super customizable, and it's free!", "it's very difficult to uninstall it please be careful while installing it", "Gave this watch face a five.  This is without a doubt, the best and most configurable watch face I've seen.", 'Perfect analog watch face! Completely customizable!', 'Perfect combination of simplicity and customisability.   Only issue I have is that when in ambient mode, with classic mode on, the whole watch face offsets from centre. This means some of the tick marks are off screen and not visible.

I love how many options can be changed, and how much control the end user has over the colors, complications, etc.', "A M A Z I N G Simple as-is with enough customization to get the perfect watch face. The only thing that I would like to see added is the ability to change the face's settings from the phone app.", 'Great watch face. Before this over I was changing watch faces every couple of days, but I have used this exclusively for 2 weeks now. Simple and elegant but with customisation and complications.
