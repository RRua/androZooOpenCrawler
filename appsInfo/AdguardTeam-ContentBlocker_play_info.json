For those that complained it's not working. Google doesn't support adblocker on Chrome, not this app's fault. Read instructions on how to configure it properly. Dig into the app Settings of any apps and learn what they have available is the first thing you should do for any new apps. Lastly, research and learn how to configure the app properly before you say something that make you look stupid...üòÅ This app works beautifully!", "Just installed current version to use with Samsung internet browser. Just not the same as using Chrome. For some reason can't get adguard icon to show in quick settings anymore. This was the easiest way of enabling and disabling the app temporarily. Now I have to launch the app. Why do all these software companies keep breaking things that used to work perfectly.", "It works perfectly on youtube when i open it through internet browser. Blocks 100% of ads. When you install it read the instructions on the screen, it's so simple. When I put adguard on my phone it told me what browsers I had to support it, only open youtube with that browser and it works fine, not the yt app, ads still come up on the preinstalled yt app but they're blocked in the yt opened with the browser. 10/10üëçü§§", "Doesn't block if anything I get more ads.. on my homescreen I get one or two ads if I'm not using another app or open, YouTube videos pause and ads pop up, ads on my music player.... ads, ads, ads, ADS! If you want more or the same amount of ads with no decrease or system change to prevent ads.. this is for you.... uninstall and does nothing.. DO NOT INSTALL!! :)", 'Probably the best free ad blocker, allows you to specify which of multiple lists to use for blocking ads in different regions or blocking annoyances like ad blocker blockers and social media buttons. I wish it was easier to whitelist sites though.', "It does what it should for the most part blocks 99% of the ads when I uncheck show acceptable ads. Would like to see couple of more options one block videos from automatically playing a lot of websites are doing this now and it's really annoying. But also some add still get through like ones that creep up from the bottom or from the top. It's the only one that works though with Samsung or Yandex the others don't even work.", "As a user of the full app I looked into the add on in order to easily add user rules of html elements of my choice like I can on pc. Sadly it isn't possible and I must enter the app and enter the element url manually. A long press context menu option to block element would be awesome", 'LOVE IT! One small suggestion, though: I wish there was a way to stop or cut down on animations. Not just gifs, but all the little things websites have that bounce around and flicker and slide.', 'I though it was a general Ad blocker ( in every app blocker ), but is just a browser ad blocker, and not even a usefull one i mean, the browsers that this supports already have the adblock function... for chrome you have to install another app', 'Perfect üëå specially for galaxy, had it on my s9 now on my s20... to the point. Blocks ALL add, with no unnecessary installs... other apps have install a whole bunch of other programs and stuff, highly recommend it!', "Of all the content blockers I've tried for Samsung Internet browser, this one is the best IMO. Lots of options to customize. This app does what it says much better than any other similar I've tried.", 'One of the best adblockers out there. Get AdGuard and you WILL be happy! No Youtube ads, no Google ads, anti-tracking custom lists. Thank you for your service.

Thank you!', "The best ad blocker app ever! I'm am very pleased with this, having no problems at all. Thank you", "Works mostly. No ads on videos but still have visual ads appearing on pages. But I like no ads when playing videos so not interrupted when watching videos. The pop ups ads don't appear anymore by fixing the settings .", "In my experience, this is true ad blocker. I use it on my laptop too and it doesn't allow any kind of advertisement.", "this app works great with samsung browser. However, it doesn't allow adding third-party filters (not user filters). The pre-installed lists are not enough for me if possible, please add this feature. Thank you", 'Wow this app is really good and flawless. I never thought there was an app that effectively blocked ads and popups so easily. My thanks to you.', "I had the issue of GOOGLE ads on my phone. Went into settings to TURN OFF personalized ads but they were still popping up. After I downloaded this they've stopped completely. thank you!", 'Excellent app. It does exactly what it says on the tin. No fuss, no unnecessary nonsense, just blocks unwanted content effectively. Thanks a million for creating this terrific app.', "It's interesting how it's an external download, but I'm glad Samsung has integrated it into their browser. It truly does work and I'm happy to report a good review.", "What are ad blockers supposed to do exactly? I still get ads on my phone when I'm not even on the damn internet. They just randomly pop up when my phone is sitting there plugged in.", 'I love this app. Not having to duck and dodge all of the pop ups and unsolicited ads.', 'Best adblock i have used.
