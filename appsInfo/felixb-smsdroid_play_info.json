I need some solution for this', 'I think a lot of reviewers have missed the point of this app. If all you want to do is send a regular SMS though your phone\'s provider then this probably isn\'t the app for you. It is most powerful when coupled with WebSMS, allowing me to automatically send messages for certain number prefixes through a cheaper web-based provider.  My first complaint is that it could look a little prettier. It\'s not as ugly as WebSMS but a little padding around the text could make all the difference. Perhaps the developer wanted to fit as much text on the screen as possible but screens are relatively large and high resolution these days. The "Black" theme is also more like grey under the Material Glass theme for some reason. With those two issues fixed, it would look much like the stock Messaging app.  My next complaint is that starting a new thread fires up the WebSMS interface instead of allowing you to type into SMSdroid directly. This inconsistency is a little jarring and there seems little reason for it. I guess SMSdroid is simply lacking a recipient selector.  My last complaint is a minor one. The multi-select button doesn\'t actually do anything.  All in all, a thumbs up from me.', 'Fantastic, only app I found that works on Marshmallow for writing texts to sent items.', 'Very hard.
