{'title': 'Renetik Android Library - Sample Application', 'description': "Framework to enjoy, improve and speed up your application development while writing readable code.\r\n\r\nI started with this framework few years ago with my first Android application and made similar framework with similar classes for iOS too so I could write more easily two applications from my client fro both platfroms, one for Android and other for iOS while keeping similar structure of code. Then framework mutated as I was easily developing apps further and 3 months ago I rewrote this framework to kotlin and polished while removing large old unused parts with idea to release it for others and showcase how I code for development clients or companies who can hire me for software development. I didn't try to re-invent the wheel but with background from multiple platfroms and languages I just see how things can be done nicely without some overcomlexities of Android framework like activities lifetime, fragments, java listeners and so on. For example I missed event classes similar to that used in c# and other programming patterns, like Navigation from iOS so I made them. I am sure there are number of other libraries that alrady has those features, with some pros and cons, but I was able to keep this code functional and usefull for me for quite a few years so I dont need to look for code from others that can be quite dificult to fix if problems happens. I always tried to use good libraries but for example CSEvent classes are quite old maybe 7 years now, and are still quite usefull and well tested by time. So I believe it's good time to share this with some guide how this can be used for rapid and high quality application development.", 'descriptionHTML': 'Framework to enjoy, improve and speed up your application development while writing readable code.<br><br>I started with this framework few years ago with my first Android application and made similar framework with similar classes for iOS too so I could write more easily two applications from my client fro both platfroms, one for Android and other for iOS while keeping similar structure of code.
