I never leave reviews, but this app was clearly made by smart people that wanted to provide a good service. It just works. It's clever, it's low lag, it's as high quality as your internet allows. And the interface is pleasant and simple while also granting me control and not treating me like an idiot. I'm blown away. Sadly, it won't get through Hulu's block, and I can't watch Hulu on a computer with my phone, and that's kind of what I got the app forðŸ˜­. But still, great potential here ðŸ‘Œ", "I have been using this application for last few months, and it works great. This is the best app to cast Android screen on laptop using WiFi. No need to use any data cable and the best thing is that you don't need to install any application on Windows, Mac or Linux. Just stay this app, and open given address in the browser tab to view Android screen on laptop.", "It's almost perfect but would be nice if I could do more than 60 frame's per a second. I had a mouse plugged in to my phone and on my phone screen it worked fine but seens there's such a low fram rate for dvice receiving streem mouse took time to get were it actually was.", 'This is really good. Work perfect. But somtime slow when it connected with hotspot. But with thethering usb it is so fast and great. Remember JUST FOR MIRRORING. And it is what i need to see', 'It works well but cant stream audio and dies after 1h after which you have to reset, i dont know if i could pay to not have my streams stopped mid game but id love a full version', 'No sound in screen streaming. Please solve this problem. But this app is very best. Thank you for this app. Keep it up.', "The program works properly, but I have to refresh the web page sometimes because it stops mirroring. I couldn't understand why?", 'Great app! If you set to 30fps it becomes very smooth. Thank you! Im really glad you made this!', "This app is very good but when I'm using OBS the phone stream quality decreases.", 'Excellent app. Thank you. Very important that the code is available as well.', 'Using this to mirror the phone image from my DJI drone, and it works surprisingly well.', 'Wow never expected seeing something so genuine. The idea is awesome and the mirroring is also very smooth. Love it!', 'I been using this and dont no if it has been hacked wen i do use it why i do say how i use it is cause wat if its hack proof and saying how to use it now exposes how to hack so i wont talk about it unless its in person. It cuts off but it cuts off wen my internet goes down and then back on so im thinking thats the only way i seen how any one gets on my net is wen at times i lose signal and wen the net goes back on then i notice things', 'Best ever.

LOVE IT!!!', 'Link Not Working / Opening in Google Croma Browser..Setting Please For Browser Nad Android....', 'Its 5 times better than other casting apps here on playstore.good job man.', 'Searching for this type of.....finaly got it. Good app. Very easy to use. Thanks developers.', 'Add video with audio streaming options', 'If you have a Smart TV or Amazon Fire Stick and a smartphone that is incompatible with screen mirror/screen cast, look no further.

Edit: I went looking at others and this is still my favourite. Good simple interface and features no others have. It duplicates your phone screen to your PC very quickly.
