My default document viewer is having trouble opening these moderately big sized txt files  but with aGrep, opening and viewing the text within the search results is amazingly fast. It is also easy to cancel the searching so you can quickly change the search parameters if you made a mistake on your input. (Doing all this search process on a mainstream desktop PC will display the results instantaneously)  I don't know if it is about my Phone's processing power that the search result takes some time.
